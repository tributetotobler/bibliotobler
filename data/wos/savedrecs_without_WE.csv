One method of contrasting the Mercator projection is to present an alternative in the form of an equal area projection. The map projection derived here is thus not simply a pretty Christmas tree ornament: it is instead a complement to Mercator's conformal navigation anamorphose and can be displayed as an alternative. The equations for the new map projection preserve the latitudinal stretching of the Mercator while adjusting the longitudinal spacing. This allows placement of the new map adjacent to that of Mercator. The surface area, while drastically warped, maintains the correct magnitude.","2018","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","284-285","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000425064400008","","","","","","","equal area; Map projection; Mercator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In both methods, (1) the areal data are reproduced when the predicted population density is upscaled; (2) physical boundary conditions are accounted for, if they exist; and (3) inequality constraints, such as the requirement of non-negative point predictions, are satisfied. The results show that when a certain variogram model, that is, the de Wijsian model corresponding to the free-space Green's function of Laplace's equation, is used in the geostatistical approach under the same boundary condition and constraints with Tobler's approach, the predicted population density surfaces are almost identical (up to numerical errors and discretization discrepancies). The implications of these findings are twofold: (1) multiple attribute surfaces can be constructed from areal data using the geostatistical approach, depending on the particular point variogram model adopted-that variogram model need not be the one associated with Tobler's solution and (2) it is the analyst's responsibility to justify whether the smoothness criterion employed in Tobler's approach is relevant to the particular application at hand. A notable advantage of the geostatistical approach over Tobler's is that it allows reporting the uncertainty or reliability of the interpolated values, with critical implications for uncertainty propagation in spatial analysis operations.","2010-01","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","78-98","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000273942200006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, based on a presentation from the 1960s, a direct and simple introduction is given to the design of a computer algorithm for the construction of contiguous value-by-area cartograms. As an example, a table of latitude/longitude to rectangular plane coordinates is included for a cartogram of the United States, along with Tissot's measures for this map projection. This is followed by a short review of the subsequent history of the subject and includes citation of algorithms proposed by others. In contrast to the usual geographic map, the most common use of cartograms is solely for the display and emphasis of a geographic distribution. A second use is in analysis, as a nomograph or problem-solving device similar in use to Mercator's projection, or in the transform-solve-invert paradigm. Recent innovations by computer scientists modify the objective and suggest variation similar to Airy's (1861) ""balance of errors"" idea for map projections.","2004-03","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","58-73","","1","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000189291300004","","","","","","","anamorphoses; AREA CARTOGRAMS; cartograms; map distortion; map projections; MAP PROJECTIONS; quasiconformal; TRANSFORMATIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All the subsystems or components in the driveline from the engine to the wheels are integrated into the overall vehicle powertrain model. Standard library models are directly used for some of the common components used in the powertrain such as gears, inertia, clutches, etc. Other components such as the engine, torque converter, shift controller are either developed independently or adopted from existing sources. A 4-speed automatic transmission is used as an example in the paper to illustrate the modelling and simulation. The dynamic behaviour of the transmission in up and down shift processes is simulated by the model under various powertrain operation conditions. The simulation data on shift transmissions such as torque hole, torque overshoot, shift time, etc., are quantitatively analysed for the assessment of shift quality. Shift control variables are adjusted interactively to calibrate the transmission for the best trade off between shift time and smoothness based on model simulation.","2003","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","273-289","","3-4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000184925600007","","","","","","","automatic transmissions; powertrain dynamics; transmission modelling and simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model integrates the traction drive CVT subsystem into an existing overall vehicle system. The characteristics of engine output torque are formulated using neural networks, and torque converter is modeled using lookup tables. Component inputs and outputs are coupled in the dynamic equations and interfaces in the, powertrain system. The model simulation can provide evaluations of vehicle performance in driveability, fuel economy and emission levels for various drive ranges prior to the prototyping of the vehicle. As a design tool, the model assists engineers in understanding the effect of powertrain components on vehicle performance and making decisions in the selection of key design parameters. The model is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The performance simulation of a test vehicle is included in the paper as a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.","2001","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","496-502","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000169681100112","","","","","","","CVT; modeling; traction drive; vehicle simulation","","Qin, DT; Chen, XO; Chen, BK; Lin, C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL TRANSMISSIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The control system must provide quick ratio response and stability for vehicle driveability and performance. In this paper, a computer model is presented for the analysis and simulation of traction drive CVT control systems. Stability studies are performed for control systems with single or dual feedbacks. Based on the model simulation, a control strategy with dual feedbacks on both the swing and the translation of the CVT variator is found to be effective and stable. The control model is implemented using Matlab/Simulink block diagrams. The paper includes a numerical example where the ratio response of a traction drive is simulated for a preselected drive range. The simulation results confirm ratio stability and responsiveness for stepped ratio control commands.","2001","2021-12-15 11:03:11","2021-12-15 11:03:11","","503-507","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000169681100113","","","","","","","CVT; modeling; simulation; traction drive","","Qin, DT; Chen, XO; Chen, BK; Lin, C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL TRANSMISSIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparison of geographic phenomena requires a two-dimensional extension of this technique. In this manner geographic maps can be compared with each other. Possible applications include geometric comparison of ancient and modern maps, or of ''mental'' maps, or for rubber-sheeting as used in Geographic Information Systems and in remote sensing. Other applications, for example, in biology for the comparison of shapes of leaves, fish, faces, or skulls after the manner of D'Arcy W. Thompson are also possible, as are higher-dimensional and multivariate cases. The method implements, and puts into this new context, existing models from the field of cartography. The linear case yields an easy definition of a Pearsonian-like correlation coefficient. The bidimensional case is richer in mathematical options than is the usual unidimensional version. The curvilinear case is of even greater utility. Here the regression coefficients constitute a spatially varying, but coordinate invariant, second-order tensor field defined by the matrix of partial derivatives of the transformation. This can be shown to be essentially equivalent to Tissot's Indicatrix, used in cartography to determine the properties of a map protection. In a computer implementation a nonparametric approach allows visualization of the regression by automatically plotting the pair of scatter diagrams, drawing of the displacement field, differentiable smooth interpolation of the warped coordinates and predicted image, by a diagram of the principal strains, and with contour maps of the estimated local angular, areal, and total distortion.","1994-07","2021-12-15 11:03:12","2021-12-15 11:03:12","","187-212","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:A1994NV78800002","","","","","","","TRANSFORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
