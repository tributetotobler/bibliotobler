Models deduced from work in two research domains, allometric theory and spatial database theory, are calibrated using regression analysis based on data for 240 Census Bureau Dual Independent Map Encoding (DIME) files for the 1980 U.S. census of population. The predictive power of the derived regression models is high (r2 > .85), indicating that file size is closely correlated with urban area and population. The derived relationships may be useful in a variety of theoretical and applied contexts, including prediction of file size to enhance the efficiency of digital data encoding and transfer, estimation of execution time for spatial models such as shortest path and polygon overlay, and provision of base data necessary for fractal models of city structure and evolution.","1997-05-01","2020-05-13 19:57:34","2021-02-09 13:41:23","2020-05-13 19:57:34","277-290","","3","21","","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","","Remote Sensing of Urban Systems","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","CC296","","","C:\Users\cplume01\Zotero\storage\WKDDLLXM\S0198971597000124.html","","CC-SIG (GIS); LocCC-OKleinpdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We note that studies using satellites as collection devices yield results indexed by latitude and longitude. Thus it makes sense to assemble the terrestrial arrangement of people in a compatible manner. This alternative is explored here, using latitude/longitude quadrilaterals as bins for population information. This format also has considerable advantages for analytical studies. Ways of achieving the objective include, among others, simple centroid sorts, interpolation, or gridding of polygons. The results to date of putting world boundary coordinates together with estimates of the number of people are described. The estimated 1994 population of 219 countries, subdivided into 19,032 polygons, has been assigned to over six million five minute by five minute quadrilaterals covering the world. These results are available over the Internet. The grid extends from latitude 57°S to 72°N, and covers 360° of longitude. Just under 31% of the (1548 by 4320) grid cells are populated. The number of people in these countries is estimated to be 5.6 billion, spread over 132 million km2 of land.

La Renaissance et la redécouverte des œuvres de Ptolémée introduisent les voyages d'exploration et la technologie de l'imprimerie, menant à la période des grands atlas et aux rendus panoramiques de Da Vinci, Duerer et Meran. Les problèmes de la découverte de la longitude et de la géodésie géométrique et physique se posent alors à l'Académie française et à la Royal Society. Cette période a également vu les importantes anamorphoses de Mercator, Lambert et Gauss, et le développement de la théorie de l'ajustement des observations. Les cartes topographiques contemporaines datent de cette époque. Des extensions plus récentes incluent des cartes nautiques et aéronautiques et des observations de ballons, d'avions et de satellites. Cartes de l'Extrême-Orient, de l'Afrique. La relation des cartes géographiques avec la science et les statistiques, illustrant des données thématiques abstraites et des phénomènes non visuels, revêt une importance croissante.

As an example, a table of latitude/longitude to rectangular plane coordinates is included for a cartogram of the United States, along with Tissot's measures for this map projection. This is followed by a short review of the subsequent history of the subject and includes citation of algorithms proposed by others. In contrast to the usual geographic map, the most common use of cartograms is solely for the display and emphasis of a geographic distribution. A second use is in analysis, as a nomograph or problem-solving device similar in use to Mercator's projection, or in the transform-solve-invert paradigm. Recent innovations by computer scientists modify the objective and suggest variation similar to Airy's (1861) “balance of errors” idea for map projections.","2004-03","2020-04-29 16:08:08","2021-02-09 13:41:12","2020-04-29 16:08:08","58-73","","1","94","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","CC149","","","C:\Users\cplume01\Zotero\storage\CTJ8KKHJ\Tobler - 2004 - Thirty Five Years of Computer Cartograms.pdf","","LocCC-CDMP; CC-Cartogramme","Anamorphoses; cartograms; map distortion; map projections; quasiconformal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is then shown how this formulation needs to be modified to apply to a migration model on the surface of the Earth, considered spherical. The corresponding spherical finite djfference equations are derived As an abstract model the equations may also be used to describe any type of movement, including commodity movements, etc., on the surface of the Earth. The implications for data collection, however, are severe because the model assumes that the necessary empirical information is given by spherical quadrilaterals.","1997-01","2020-05-13 20:30:23","2021-02-09 13:41:10","","97-103","","","1","","Geographical & Environmental Modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","CC137","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228879579_Movement_Modelling_on_the_Sphere'","⛔ No DOI found; LocCC-CDMV; CC-Mouvements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparison of geographic phenomena requires a two-dimensional extension of this technique. In this manner geographic maps can be compared with each other. Possible applications include geometric comparison of ancient and modern maps, or of “mental” maps, or for rubber-sheeting as used in Geographic Information Systems and in remote sensing. Other applications, for example, in biology for the comparison of shapes of leaves, fish, faces, or skulls after the manner of D'Arcy W. Thompson are also possible, as are higher-dimensional and multivariate cases. The method implements, and puts into this new context, existing models from the field of cartography. The linear case yields an easy definition of a Pearsonian-like correlation coefficient. The bidimensional case is richer in mathematical options than is the usual unidimensional version. The curvilinear case is of even greater utility. Here the regression coefficients constitute a spatially varying, but coordinate invariant, second-order tensor field defined by the matrix of partial derivatives of the transformation. This can be shown to be essentially equivalent to Tissot's Indicatrix, used in cartography to determine the properties of a map projection. In a computer implementation a nonparametric approach allows visualization of the regression by automatically plotting the pair of scatter diagrams, drawing of the displacement field, differentiable smooth interpolation of the warped coordinates and predicted image, by a diagram of the principal strains, and with contour maps of the estimated local angular, areal, and total distortion.","1994","2020-04-14 08:44:14","2021-02-09 13:41:10","2020-04-13 20:01:30","187-212","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","1994 The Ohio State University","","","","Wiley Online Library","CC130","","<p>Résumé C.

The propagation of such events would seem likely to reveal the structure of the system. One may postulate that the general organization of the society has not changed in the last forty years, although the banking industry has been modified in its details. One would expect that technological innovations in today's society spread in a manner analogous to bank closures in that earlier period, probably at a somewhat accelerated rate.","1975-07","2020-05-11 11:18:13","2020-05-14 14:07:14","2020-05-11 10:55:08","19","","","","","","","","","","Human Settlements and Services Area (HSS)","IIASA International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis","Laxenburg, AT","en","","Monograph (IIASA Research Report)","","","","CC66","","<p>Remarque CC</p> <p>Ce rapport correspond au travail de Tobler à Laxenburg, AT en 1975.</p> <p>Ce type de texte a presque toujours fait l'objet d'un article dans une revue comme ici in Geographical Analysis</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WP-75-076","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an alternate scheme one might  use ecological zones rather than nation states to organize environmental data. But there is no agreement as  to what these zones should be. By way of contrast, global environmental studies using satellites as collection instruments yield results indexed by latitude and longitude.  Thus it makes some sense to assemble information on the terrestrial arrangement of people in a compatible manner.  This alternative is explored in the work described here, in which latitude/longitude quadrilaterals are used as bins for population information. This data format also has considerable advantage for analytical studies in which spatial series can be thought of as a two dimensional extension of time series, or for simulation modeling, etc. The result of our recent work is a five minute by five minute raster of estimated 1994 world population generated from over nineteen thousand administrative unit boundaries and covering 221 countries. The number of people in the total countries is estimated to  be 5.618xl09, spread over 1.32xlOs square kilometers of land. The full report details the methods used, problems encountered, applicability to urban areas, movement modeling and other uses, and needed extensions.","1997-04-07","2020-05-13 20:40:13","2020-05-13 20:47:40","","416-418","","","5","","","","","","","","","Seattle, Washington, US","en","","","","","","CC139","","<p>Les références CC202, CC204, CC206 rejoignent sauf doute la référence 188 (139bis).

But we know that countries are ephemeral phenomena. As an alternate scheme one might use ecological zones rather than nation states. But there is no agreement as to what these zones should be. By way of contrast, global environmental studies using satellites as collection devices yield results indexed by latitude and longitude. Thus it makes sense to assemble the terrestrial arrangement of people in a comparable manner. This alternative is explored here, using latitude/longitude quadrilaterals as bins for population information. This data format also has considerable advantage for analytical studies. The report is in three parts. Part I gives the motivation and several possible applications. Ways of achieving the objective include, among others, simple centroid sorts or interpolation. In Part II the results to date are described. The estimated 1994 population of 217 countries, subdivided into 19,032 polygons, are being assigned to latitude/longitude cells. The estimated number of people in these countries is 5,617,519,139, spread over 132,306,314 square kilometers of land. Part III describes needed extensions. By reporting population in units of one tenth of a degree for the entire earth we have data which is two orders of magnitude finer than has previously been availabe. The project has been funded by the California Space Institute, The Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network, the Environmental Systems Research Institute, and the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis.

Among these, computer science and space science have had the greater influence upon the field of research and the formation of a working body of map projection, developing them in breadth and depth. This book reflects several aspects of the development of modern mathematical cartography, especially the theory and methods of map projection transformation. Map projection transformation is an area of research in mathematical cartography newly developed over the last 25 years. It is widely used in surveying and computer-assisted cartography, data processing for information systems, and the transformation of data from space, remote sensing, and other space sciences. The development of map projection transformation not only expands new areas of research on mathematical cartography, but it also further develops the applied area with the creation and application of map projection transformation software and mapping mathematics bases on the computer.","2000","2020-05-13 20:49:07","2020-06-09 12:25:06","","","367","","","","","Map projection transformation","","","","","Taylor & Francis","London","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","CC143","","<p>Cet ouvrage a été publié  par Routledge aux USA et au Canada</p>","","","CC-Systeme_projection; LocCC-LIVRE","Cartography; Mathematics; Map projection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2PM3Z7ZE","thesis","1961","Tobler, Waldo R.","Map Transformations of Geographic Space","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/1773/5629","Many geographic and economic models of human behavior in a spatial context indicate that the measuring rod of the geodesist or surveyor is less relevant than a scaling of distance in temporal  or  monetary  units.  It  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  not  only  the  shape  of  the  earth  but  also  the  realities  of  transportation  on  this  surface.  Automobiles,  trains,  airplanes,  and  other  media  of  transport  can  be  considered  to  have  the  effect  of  modifying  distances  -  measured  in  temporal or monetary units - in a complicated manner. Different distance relations, however, can be interpreted as different types of geometry. A geographically natural approach is to attempt to map  this  geometry  to  a  plane,  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  preparation  of  maps  of  the  terrestrial  surface.  If  the  transformations  were  dependent  only  on  a  factor  of  proportionality,  as  in  the  conversion  from  miles  to  kilometers,  there  would  be  no  difficulty.  The  facts  are  considerably  more complex. The geometry with which we must deal is rarely Euclidean, and it is, in general, impossible   to   prepare   a   plane   map   preserving   all   distance   relations,   just   as   isometric   transformations  of  a  spherical  surface  to  a  plane  are  not  possible.  Maps  preserving  distance  relations from one point are easily achieved, however, whatever the units of measurement. The transformations are approached from the theory of map projections, as available and familiar  to  geographers.  Numerous  transformations  preserving  time  or  cost  distance  relations  from  (or  to)  one  location  as  foundin  actual  transport  systems  or  situations  can  be  achieved  as  azimuthal projections by relaxing the traditional assumptions applied to this class of projections. The parametric classification of map projections employed suggests a simple graphic technique for transformations of empirical data recorded in the form of isochrones or isovectures. Though   yielding   a   simple   method   of   obtaining   polar   isometric   transformations,   azimuthal projections are less appropriate than polar geodesic isometries. Neither polar isometric nor  polar  geodesic  transformations  are  unique,  and  it  is  natural  to  inquire  whether  further  conditions  may  be  applied.  Consideration  is  given  to  equal-area  maps,  conformal  maps,  and  measures  of  the  departure  of  an  environment  from  an  idealized  isotropic  geographic  space,  the  latter from Tissot’s work. Complicating factors are that time or cost distances in general do not satisfy the postulates of a metric space, they vary frequently, and are commodity specific. The differential resource distribution on the surface of the earth also suggests that equal-area maps are not always the most relevant for use by geographers. Setting Tissot’s measure of areal distortion equal to a description of the given resource density, and solving the resulting dif-ferential  equation,  yields  map  projections  which  can  be  interpreted  as  “eliminating”  a  variable  terrestrial  resource  endowment.  These  transformations  of  a  surface  integral  are  not  unique,  and  the addition of further conditions is discussed. Several  applications  of  the  transformations  are  suggested,  with  emphasis  on  theories  concerning the geographic location of economic activity.","1961","2020-04-14 08:44:14","2020-06-05 12:38:28","","","184","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington","Seattle, Washington, US","en","","PhD Thesis","61-4011","","","CC8","","<p>Résumé C.

Principal contributors to this subject were Craig and Hammer, both writing in 1910. A property of retro-azimuthal projections is that the parallels are bent downwards towards the equator. The resulting maps, when extended to the entire world, thus must overlap themselves. An unusual recent discovery from Iran suggests that Muslims might have been prior inventors of a similar projection, by at least several centuries. A later corollary by Schoy leads to a new ""cylindrical"" azimuthal map projection with parallels bending away from the equator, here illustrated for the first time.","2002-01","2020-04-30 07:30:57","2021-02-09 13:41:03","2020-04-30 07:30:57","17-23","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","CC147","","<p>Résumé C.

"BJLHA6U9","journalArticle","1969","Tobler, Waldo R.","Satellite Confirmation of Settlement Size Coefficients","Area","","","","https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~tobler/publications/pdf_docs/Satellite-Confirmation-of-settlement-size.pdf","Several investigators 'have demonstrated that the built-up area and equivalent radius of settlements can be estimated with considerable accuracy from a knowledge of the number of inhabitants. A recent circumstance, somewhat fortuitous, has led to an interesting, independent confirmation of this result. Specifically, on the basis of theoretical and empirical deductions it has been concluded that the built-up area of a settlement should be proportional to the population raised to some exponent (<1). From this it follows that the radius of a circle of the same area should be given by a formula of the form. r = aP b where P is the population. The population density is also readily deduced from this formula. For the United States empirical estimates yield the values a = 0.035, b = 0.44, when the radius is measured in kilometres. In general the built-up area differs from the area of the legal jurisdiction, and from the physical area used for enumerations. Using these coefficients, with census data plus latitude and longitude coordinates, it is possible to use a digital plotter to produce population maps, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for a portion of Michigan. Comparable maps prepared for sections of southern Germany, central Spain, and central Turkey yielded similarly reasonable results, but for a portion of the Nile Delta they suggested village overlapping to an outrageously absurd degree. There is no evidence that the Egyptian census data are seriously in error. A somewhat casual comparison of the Egyptian map plot with a Gemini photograph 2 of the same area suggested that dividing the radii of the villages by four would yield estimates of the correct order of magnitude (Fig. 2). The implication is that Egyptian towns are 16 times more compact than United States towns. This suggested a re-examination of the previous studies 1 , even though the actual project for which the maps were being prepared is relatively unrelated in objectives to these works. Table 1 summarizes the relevant observations. The phenomenon discussed for the Nile Delta is clearly consistent with Nordbeck's data for Japan. On this basis it is suggested that the coefficient a, (or a 2 /π, provides a useful characterization of settlement packing, with clear value in distinguishing between various strategies employed by society for the organization of spatial activity. Stewart and Warntz suggest that it is related to their notion of population potential. Extrapolation of the formulae to one individual yields a reasonable measure of space consumption, in principle capable of independent estimation. World-wide samples of actual measurements on the built-up area of settlements would appear to be possible if high resolution satellite photographs were available. The analysis can, of course, also be inverted, e.g., using the Apollo VI photograph (AS6-2-1462) of Dallas (Fig. 3). With 1/10 th inch coordinate paper to measure the built-up area and inferred consequences of the Public Land Survey System as a surrogate for an actual scale, fifteen minutes suffice to estimate the population at 668,000 people, which is within 2% of the 1960 census figure. To sharpen the efficacy of such estimates requires theoretical studies of the concept of built-up area, especially along the lines suggested by Nystuen 3 . The general utility and applicability of the settlement size relations, however, seems well established. Area, Vol 1, No 3 (1969); 30-34.

Hrozny discovered the source of the “Cappadocian” tablets near the village of Kültepe (38° 44′ N, 35° 34′ E). These cuneiform tablets provide a foundation for study of the pre-Hittite (circa 1940 BC to 1740 BC) network of Assyrian merchant colonies in Bronze Age Anatolia1. Bilgic2 has published the names of 119 towns active in this exchange, as evidenced by their citation on a tablet. The exact location of most of these sites is not known, and historical and archaeological investigations would be greatly facilitated if they could be found. We have used Bilgic's compilation to estimate the geographical position of several of the towns, in the sense of Bunge3, which is conditional on several assumptions. We invoke assumptions to enhance the analysis by applying the leverage obtained from geographical theory. We assume, for example, that mathematical models based on contemporary (largely western) data have a temporally and geographically invariant structure and can be applied to the Cappadocian situation. Our approach differs from several previous attempts1,2,4, to which it should be considered complementary rather than competitive. For example, we do not require the existence of itineraries; the mere mention of two town names on the same tablet is taken to define a relation between these towns. We recognize that one of the simplest geographical relations is distance and attempt to convert the tabular data into geographical distances. If this is possible then it is an almost routine matter to convert these distances into relative positions. Thus it may be possible to specify the actual locations of the towns; that is, to predict their latitude and longitude. The simplest model asserts that places which are mentioned together frequently are probably closer together than are places which are not mentioned together frequently. This spatial decay is similar to the temporal decay of linguistic relations postulated in glottochronology5, or of isotopic changes used in radiocarbon dating6. Our procedure attempts to estimate spatial, rather than temporal, origins and can be considered the geographical equivalent to these methods. It also has comparable limitations. We know of no previous use of the procedure presented here.","1971-05","2020-05-06 11:14:52","2021-02-09 13:41:01","2020-05-06 11:14:52","39-41","","5297","231","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","1971 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","CC50","","<p>DVD_Tobler All Stuff PDF Reprints Archeology</p>","C:\Users\cplume01\Zotero\storage\TNUHTPGD\Tobler et Wineburg - 1971 - A Cappadocian Speculation.pdf","","LocCC-CDSC; CC-Cartogramme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In both methods, (1) the areal data are reproduced when the predicted population density is upscaled; (2) physical boundary conditions are accounted for, if they exist; and (3) inequality constraints, such as the requirement of non-negative point predictions, are satisfied. The results show that when a certain variogram model, that is, the de Wijsian model corresponding to the free-space Green's function of Laplace's equation, is used in the geostatistical approach under the same boundary condition and constraints with Tobler's approach, the predicted population density surfaces are almost identical (up to numerical errors and discretization discrepancies). The implications of these findings are twofold: (1) multiple attribute surfaces can be constructed from areal data using the geostatistical approach, depending on the particular point variogram model adopted—that variogram model need not be the one associated with Tobler's solution and (2) it is the analyst's responsibility to justify whether the smoothness criterion employed in Tobler's approach is relevant to the particular application at hand. A notable advantage of the geostatistical approach over Tobler's is that it allows reporting the uncertainty or reliability of the interpolated values, with critical implications for uncertainty propagation in spatial analysis operations.","2010","2020-05-06 17:38:22","2021-02-09 13:41:00","2020-05-06 17:38:22","78-98","","1","42","","","Reconstructing Population Density Surfaces from Areal Data","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Ohio State University","","","","Wiley Online Library","CC155","","","","","LocCC-OKleinpdf; CC-Lissage, interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system has simple properties with respect to aggregation and turnover, yet incorporates spatial competition, adjacency, and effects of geographic shadowing. The objective function satisfied by the model reduces congestion and minimizes the per capita work; solves a quadratic transportation-problem and fulfils in-sum and out-sum constraints. The associated Lagrangians can be interpreted as pushes and pulls, or as shadow prices. A spatially continuous version of the model consists of coupled elliptical partial differential equations with Neumann boundary conditions, solvable by numerical methods. With migration data from the United States of America the model yields an amazingly good fit, better than existing models and with fewer free parameters. Inversion of the model yields an estimate of distances between regions.

Such measurements distort the true size of scotomas (or seeing areas) when the boundaries measured are farther from the center of the field on the chart because of cartographic distortion inherent with this projection. We believe that the solid angle in steradians subtended by the scotoma or the seeing area is a more appropriate measure of the visual field than area on a flat representation.

In the short run the mean activity field describes much of this behavior. However some illnesses take a long time to manifest themselves. I speculate that geographers may be able to contribute to a discussion about where people were a long time ago from studies of migration. Some comments on this problem, and possible solutions, are presented in the hope of stimulating discussion.","unknown","2020-05-21 21:22:45","2021-02-09 13:40:51","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CC262","","<p>Résumé C.

A geometrical survey can be decomposed into the determination of a configuration, a scale, an orientation, and a positioning with respect to an origin. For each of these the theory of the adjustment of observations leads to the use of the inverse covariance matrix for the weighting of data from several measurements and for specification of the error variances. This theory also provides adjustment procedures that vary depending on whether the data are collected in a graphical mode, or as a traverse, a trilateration, or a triangulation. Furthermore, departures of any configuration from a specified continuous model can be measured using Tissot's theorem. Global meeasures  such as those suggested by Airy, Jordan, and others may also be valuable for measuring overall changes in the perception of configurations over time. Different individuals can be expected to have different perceptions, and this may be interpreted as different viewing points, in the sense of photogrammetry. One is thus lead to inquiries concerning projective invariants, or affine invariants, or other metrical and non-metrical properties of mental maps.","1976","2020-05-06 20:28:39","2020-06-04 13:04:05","","69-81","","","","","","","","","","","Ohio State University Press","Columbus, OH, US","en","","","","","","CC69","","<p>Résumé C.

Même le touriste occasionnel, traversant le pays, reconnaît cette répétitivité géographique des événements. Des méthodes d'investigation appropriées pour l'analyse des périodicités dans les phénomènes géographiques peuvent être mises en place autour du concept de série spatiale. Un des problèmes est de disposer d'intervalles spatiaux égaux et de trouver le point central de chaque unité. On peut utiliser les moyennes mobiles, rechercher une tendance, calculer des coefficients d'autocorrélations, de cross-corrélations, série de Fourier.</span></p>","","","LocCC-CDSA; CC-Analyse spatiale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
