Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13'14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.",,"article; mathematical analysis; priority journal; system analysis; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Communicable Diseases; Games, Experimental; Models, Biological; Models, Neurological; Models, Theoretical; Nerve Net",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Winfree, A., T.

Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n −1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. © 1967, American Association for Cancer Research.

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.

It also discusses graphical integrity, and miscommunication and distortion. Section two covers a theory of data graphics. This includes considerations of physical tools such as ink, design factors, optical art and perceptual factors, colour usage, information content, aesthetics, text and tables.

This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from previous learning theories. How these learning mechanisms apply to produce the power law speedup in processing time with practice is discussed.

The model is coordinated to social conventions. It develops and is vulnerable to dissolution. Studies of adults' knowledge about their macroenvironment suggest that human “maps” are not literally maps. Rather, they tend to be fragmented, distorted projectively, and are often several multiple “mini-spatial-representations.” Landmarks and routes are the minimal elements of spatial representation. Survey-representations incorporate configurational elements (outlines, graphic skeletons, figurative metaphors) and may be the final derivative of dense, richly interconnected, and hierarchically organized route maps. The notion of “main sequences” was introduced as a potential explanation for the extensive parallelisms identified among ontogenesis, microgenesis, the course of pathology, and the recovery of function following pathological insult.

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog. © 1959, IEEE.

The empirical data to be analyzed are coefficients of similarity or distance within pairs (Ai, Ai), such as correlation coefficients, conditional probabilities or likelihoods, psychological choice or confusion, etc. It is desired to represent these data parsimoniously in a coordinate space, by calculating m coordinates {xia} for each Ai for a semi-metric d of preassigned form dij =d(|xi1 -xj1|, |xi2 -xj2|, ..., |xim -xjm|). The dimensionality m is sought to be as small as possible, yet satisfy the monotonicity condition that dij &lt;dkl whenever the observed data indicate that Ai is ""closer"" to Aj than Ak is to Al. Minkowski and Euclidean spaces are special metric examples of d. A general coefficient of monotonicity μ is defined, whose maximization is equivalent to optimal satisfaction of the monotonicity condition, and which allows various options both for treatment of ties and for weighting error-of-fit. A general rationale for algorithm construction is derived for maximizing μ by gradient-guided iterations; this provides a unified mathematical solution to the basic operational problems of norming the gradient to assure proper convergence, of trading between speed and robustness against undesired stationary values, and of a rational first approximation. Distinction is made between single-phase (quadratic) and two-phase (bilinear) strategies for algorithm construction, and between ""hard-squeeze"" and ""soft-squeeze"" tactics within these strategies. Special reference is made to the rank-image and related transformational principles, as executed by current Guttman-Lingoes families of computer programs. © 1968 Psychometric Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guttman, L.; The Hebrew UniversityIsrael",,,"Springer-Verlag",,,,,00333123,,,,"English","Psychometrika",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013602888

Geographic Information Analysis, Second Edition is fully updated to keep pace with the most recent developments of spatial analysis in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment. Still focusing on the universal aspects of this science, this revised edition includes new coverage on geovisualization and mapping as well as recent developments using local statistics. Building on the fundamentals, this book explores such key concepts as spatial processes, point patterns, and autocorrelation in area data, as well as in continuous fields. Also addressed are methods for combining maps and performing computationally intensive analysis. New chapters tackle mapping, geovisualization, and local statistics, including the Moran Scatterplot and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). An appendix provides a primer on linear algebra using matrices. Complete with chapter objectives, summaries, ""thought exercises,"" explanatory diagrams, and a chapter-by-chapter bibliography, Geographic Information Analysis is a practical book for students, as well as a valuable resource for researchers and professionals in the industry. © 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, these efforts--collectively known as the ""new economic geography""--have devoted little attention to the policy implications of the new theory. Economic Geography and Public Policy fills the gap by illustrating many new policy insights economic geography models can offer to the realm of theoretical policy analysis. Focusing primarily on trade policy, tax policy, and regional policy, Richard Baldwin and coauthors show how these models can be used to make sense of real-world situations. The book not only provides much fresh analysis but also synthesizes insights from the existing literature. The authors begin by presenting and analyzing the widest range of new economic geography models to date. From there they proceed to examine previously unaddressed welfare and policy issues including, in separate sections, trade policy (unilateral, reciprocal, and preferential), tax policy (agglomeration with taxes and public goods, tax competition and agglomeration), and regional policy (infrastructure policies and the political economy of regional subsidies). A well-organized, engaging narrative that progresses smoothly from fundamentals to more complex material, Economic Geography and Public Policy is essential reading for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers seeking new approaches to spatial policy issues. © 2003 by Princeton University Press.

We describe an exponential family of distributions that can be used for analyzing such data. A substantive rationale for the general model is presented, and several special cases are discussed along with some possible substantive interpretations. A computational algorithm based on iterative scaling procedures for use in fitting data is described, as are the results of a pilot simulation study. An example using previously reported empirical data is worked out in detail. An extension to multiple relationship data is discussed briefly. © 1981, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized iterative scaling; Networks; Random digraphs; Sociometry",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SOC 77-25821; Foundation for Child Development, FCD; Educational Testing Service, ETS; U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, HEW: I R01 HD 12506-01, SOC 77-25823","* Paul W.

Traditionally, point interpolation is applied to isarithmic, that is, contour mapping and areal interpolation to isopleth mapping. Recently, areal interpolation techniques have been used to obtain data for a set of administrative or political districts from another set of districts whose boundaries do not coincide. For point interpolation, the numerous methods may further be classified into exact and approximate. Exact methods include most distance-weighting methods, Kriging, spline interpolation, interpolating polynomials, and finite-difference methods. Approximate methods include power-series trend models, Fourier models, distance-weighted least- squares, and least-squares fitting with splines. Areal interpolation methods, on the other hand, are classified according to whether they preserve volume. Traditional areal interpolation methods which utilize point interpolation procedures are not volume-preserving, whereas the map overlay and pycnophylactic methods are. It is shown that methods possessing the volume-preserving property generally outperform those that do not. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Areal interpolation; Contouring; Kriging; Map overlay; Pycnophylactic; Spline; Trend surface; Two-dimensional interpolation; Volume-preserving","contouring; Kriging; overlay; spline; trend surface; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; MAPS AND MAPPING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahlberg, J.H., Spline approximation and computer-aided design (1970) Advances in Computers, 10, pp. 275-289; Armstrong, M., Jabin, R., Variogram models must be positive-definite (1981) Mathematical Geology, 13 (5), pp. 455-459; Bassett, K., Numerical methods for map analysis (1972) Progress in Geography, 4, pp. 217-254; Bhattacharyya, B.K., Bicubic spline interpolation as a method for treatment of potential field data (1969) Geophysics, 34 (3), pp. 402-423; Bhattacharyya, B.K., Holroyd, M.R., Numerical treatment and automatic mapping of two-dimensional data in digital form (1971) Proceedings, 9Th International Symposium of Techniques for Decision-Making in the Mineral Industry, 12, pp. 148-158; Briggs, I.C., Machine contouring using minimum curvature (1974) Geophysics, 39, pp. 39-48; Casetti, E., Analysis of spatial association by trigonometric polynomials (1966) Canadian Geographer, 10, pp. 199-204; Cavendish, J.C., Automatic triangulation of arbitrary planar domains for the finite element method (1974) International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 8, pp. 679-696; Chorley, R.J., Haggett, P., Trend surface mapping in geographical research.

People make large systematic errors in judging the geographical relations between two locations that are in different geographical or political units. There is a strong tendency to distort the judged relation to conform with the relation of the superordinate political unit. To account for this result, we present a model in which spatial information is stored hierarchically. Spatial relations between any two locations are stored explicitly only if those locations are within the same superordinate unit. Spatial relations not stored are inferred by combining the relations from between and within superordinate units. © 1978.",,"article; decision making; depth perception; human; perception disorder; Human; Judgment; Perceptual Distortion; Space Perception; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,,"This study is a portion of a PhD dissertation submitted to the University of California, San Diego by the first author.

We refer to the sorted array of black nodes as the “linear quadtree” and show that it introduces a saving of at least 66 percent of the computer storage required by regular quadtrees. Some algorithms using linear quadtrees are presented, namely, (i) encoding a pixel from a 2n × 2&gt;n array (or screen) into its quaternary code; (ii) finding adjacent nodes; (iii) determining the color of a node; (iv) superposing two images. It is shown that algorithms (i)-(iii) can be executed in logarithmic time, while superposition can be carried out in linear time with respect to the total number of black nodes.

New advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing now permit scientists to access spatial data at several different resolutions. The Internet facilitates fast and easy data acquisition. In any one study, several different types of data may be collected at differing scales and resolutions, at different spatial locations, and in different dimensions. Many statistical issues are associated with combining such data for modeling and inference. This article gives an overview of these issues and the approaches for integrating such disparate data, drawing on work from geography, ecology, agriculture, geology, and statistics. Emphasis is on state-of-the-art statistical solutions to this complex and important problem.","Change of support; Data assimilation; Ecological inference; Modifiable areal unit problem; Multiscale processes; Spatially-misaligned data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldworth, J., Cressie, N., Sampling designs and prediction methods for Ganssian spatial processes (1999) Multivariate Analyses, Design of Experiments, and Survey Sampling, pp. 1-54. , ed.

It is shown that a function whose spectrum is restricted to a finite region of wave-number space may be reconstructed from its samples taken over a periodic lattice having suitably small repetition vectors. The most efficient lattice (i.e., requiring minimum sampling points per unit hypervolume) is not in general rectangular, nor is a unique reconstruction function associated with a given sampling lattice. The above results also apply to homogeneous wave-number-limited stochastic processes in the sense of a vanishing mean-square error. It is also found that, given a particular sampling lattice, the optimum (mean-square) presampling filter for nonwave-number-limited processes effects an ideal wave-number cutoff appropriate to the specified sampling lattice. Particular attention is paid to isotropic processes: minimum sampling lattices are specified up to eight-dimensional spaces, and a number of typical reconstruction functions are calculated. © 1962.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Petersen, D.P.; Weather System Center, , East Hartford, CT, United States",,,,,,,,00199958,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001069518

We extended this previous work to a natural environment that has no predetermined, well-defined hierarchical structure. Using an algorithm that generates a hierarchy of landmarks from recall protocols, we constructed hypothesized clusterings of landmarks for a set of subjects familiar with the space. Then we tested these hypothesized clusters in a series of tasks, all of which required judgments about distances in the space. The results of these tests suggest that subjects do cluster landmarks on the basis of nonspatial attributes, and that the clusters have consequences for performance in various tasks that require access to spatial information. © 1985 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",,"adult; article; cognition; depth perception; distance perception; female; human; memory; Adult; Cognition; Distance Perception; Female; Human; Maps; Memory; Space Perception; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, G.L., A developmental perspective on the effects of “subdividing” macrospatial experience (1981) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 7, pp. 120-132; Baird, J.C., Studies of the cognitive representation of spatial relations (1979) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 108, pp. 90-106; Briggs, R., Urban cognitive distance (1973) Image and environment, pp. 361-388. , R.

Third, new reiterative and forcing manipulative techniques for choroplethic map data processing have been evolved.

The interpolating function is a fifth-degree polynomial in x and y defined in each triangular cell whmh has projections of three data points in the x-y plane as its vertexes. Each polynomial is determined by the given values of z and estimated values of partial derivatives at the vertexes of the triangle. Procedures for dividing the x-y plane into a number of triangles, for estimating partial derivatives at each data point, and for determining the polynomial in each triangle are described A simple example of the application of the proposed method is shown. © 1978, ACM.

It is demonstrated that the proposed geostatistical framework can explicitly and consistently account for the support differences between the available areal data and the sought-after point predictions. In particular, it is proved that appropriate modeling of all area-to-area and area-to-point covariances required by the geostatistical framework yields coherent (mass-preserving or pycnophylactic) predictions. In other words, the areal average (or areal total) of point predictions within any arbitrary area informed by an areal-average (or areal-total) datum is equal to that particular datum. In addition, the proposed geostatistical framework offers the unique advantage of providing a measure of the reliability (standard error) of each point prediction. It is also demonstrated that several existing approaches for area-to-point interpolation can be viewed within this geostatistical framework. More precisely, it is shown that (i) the choropleth map case corresponds to the geostatistical solution under the assumption of spatial independence at the point support level; (ii) several forms of kernel smoothing can be regarded as alternative (albeit sometimas incoherent) implementations of the geostatistical approach; and (iii) Tobler's smooth pycnophylactic interpolation, on a quasi-infinite domain without non-negativity constraints, corresponds to the geostatistical solution when the semivariogram model adopted at the point support level is identified to the free-space Green's functions (linear in 1-D or logarithmic in 2-D) of Poisson's partial differential equation. In lieu of a formal case study, several 1-D examples are given to illustrate pertinent concepts.",,"geostatistics; interpolation; spatial analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., (1958) an Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Atkinson, P.M., Martin, D., Investigating the effect of support size on population surface models (1999) Geographical and Environmental Modelling, 3, pp. 101-119; Atkinson, P.M., Tate, N.J., Spatial scale problems and geostatistical solutions: A review (2000) Professional Geographer, 52, pp. 607-623; Bertero, M., Boccacci, P., (1998) Introduction to Inverse Problems in Imaging, , Bristol: Institute of Physics Publishing; Bracken, I., Martin, D., The generation of spatial population distributions from census centroid data (1989) Environment and Planning A, 21, pp. 537-543; Brillinger, D.R., Spatial-temporal modeling of spatially aggregate birth data (1990) Survey Methodology, 16, pp. 255-269; Brillinger, D.R., Examples of scientific problems and data analyses in demography, neurophysiology, and seismology (1994) Journal of Computation and Graphical Statistics, 3, pp. 1-22; Carr, J.R., Palmer, J.A., Revisiting the accurate calculation of block-sample covariances using gauss quadrature (1993) Mathematical Geology, 25, pp. 507-524; Chilès, J.P., Delfiner, P., (1999) Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Cressie, N.A.C., (1993) Statistics for Spatial Data, , Revised edition.

Data on the radial image size as a function of peripheral angle differ slightly from those of an earlier study. New data on tangential and area projection also show marked variation with eccentricity. In the peripheral retina, the area corresponding to a solid degree is shown to reach half of the foveal value. This is related to the size of the lesion viewed ophthalmoscopically, and is a source of error in existing data on the spatial projections of retinal cell densities. The effect is further exaggerated by the conventional perimeter chart, which gives rise to an area distortion of 400 per cent. in the 80° to 90° region when relating the plotted scotoma area to the receptive area of the retina.",,"eye; model; retina; retina image; theoretical study; vision; visual field; Cornea; Human; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Ocular Physiology; Ophthalmoscopy; Perimetry; Refraction, Ocular; Retina; Scotoma; Visual Fields",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Drasdo, N.; Department of Ophthalmic Optics, University of Aston, Gosta Green, Birmingham B4 7ET, United Kingdom",,,"BMJ Publishing Group",,,,,00071161,,BJOPA,"4433482","English","Br.

This paper uses both mathematical and ""Monte Carlo"" results to establish and clarify the possibility of thus extracting metric information from purely ordinal data for two multidimensional cases: (a) analysis of proximities, in which one is given a single rank order of all n(n-1) 2 pairs of n objects with respect to psychological similarity or ""proximity""; and (b) nonmetric factor analysis, in which one is given a different rank order of n individual objects with respect to each of m psychological attributes. As n (and m) increase, the ordinal data are found to determine a spatial representation of the objects more and more nearly to within a general similarity transformation, in the case of analysis of proximities, or an affine transformation, in the case of nonmetric factor analysis.

A possible alternative is to derive dasy- metric maps at a fine spatial resolution by making use of satellite imagery in a geographical information system. However, there are cartographic problems when these maps are displayed and further processing is needed in order to obtain approximations to a continuous density surface. Isarithmic maps of these density surfaces retain a high degree of spatial accuracy while providing pleasing and highly adaptable presentations. The methods used to generate dasymetric and isarithmic maps are readily implemented in most raster based geographical information systems. For example, the classification of remotely sensed imagery, the subsequent processing and integration of data, and most of the cartographic display, were all undertaken in this work using the low cost IDRISI GIS that operates on standard IBM PC compatible hardware. © 1994 Maney Publishing.",,"choropleth map; GIS; isarithmic map; mapping technique; population mapping; remote sensing; spatial distribution; article; audiovisual equipment; demography; developed country; Europe; Geographic Factors; geography; Northern Europe; population; United Kingdom; Developed Countries; England; Europe; Geographic Factors; Maps; Northern Europe; Population; Spatial Distribution; United Kingdom; Demography; Developed Countries; England; Europe; Geography; Great Britain; Maps; Population",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, R.S., Some methodological issues in computer drawn maps (1976) The Cartographic Journal, 13, pp. 145-155; Bithell, J.F., An application of density estimation to geographical epidemiology (1990) Statistics in Medicine, 9, pp. 691-701; Browne, J.J., Millington, A.C., An evaluation of the use of grid squares in computerised choropleth maps (1983) The Cartographic Journal, 20, pp. 71-75; Brunsdon, C., Estimating probability surfaces in GIS: An adaptive technique (1991) Proceedings Second European Conference on Geographical Information Systems, pp. 155-164. , Herts, J., Ottens, H.

Then, based on a presentation from the 1960s, a direct and simple introduction is given to the design of a computer algorithm for the construction of contiguous value-by-area cartograms. As an example, a table of latitude/longitude to rectangular plane coordinates is included for a cartogram of the United States, along with Tissot's measures for this map projection. This is followed by a short review of the subsequent history of the subject and includes citation of algorithms proposed by others. In contrast to the usual geographic map, the most common use of cartograms is solely for the display and emphasis of a geographic distribution. A second use is in analysis, as a nomograph or problem-solving device similar in use to Mercator's projection, or in the transform-solve-invert paradigm. Recent innovations by computer scientists modify the objective and suggest variation similar to Airy's (1861) ""balance of errors"" idea for map projections. © 2004 by Association of American Geographers.","Anamorphoses; Cartograms; Map distortion; Map projections; Quasiconformal","cartogram; historical perspective; mapping; Tissot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Airy, G., Explanation of a projection by balance of errors for maps applying to a very large extent of the earth's surface, and comparison of this projection with other projections (1861) Philosophical Magazine, 22, pp. 409-421; Appel, A., Evangelisti, C., Stein, A., Animating quantitative maps with cellular automata (1983) IBM Technical Discovery Bulletin, 26 (3 A), pp. 953-956; Biernacki, F., (1965) Theory of Representation of Surfaces for Surveyors and Cartographers, Trans., pp. 53-147. , from Polish, Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Commerce; Brandon, C., (1978) Confrontations with Cartograms: Computer-aided Map Designs and Animations, , B.A. thesis, Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, Harvard University; Canters, F., (2002) Small-scale Map Projection Design, , London: Taylor & Francis; Cauvin, C., Schneider, C., Cartographic transformations and the piezopleth maps method (1989) Cartographic Journal, 26, pp. 96-104; Dent, B., (1999) Cartography: Thematic Map Design. 5th Ed., , New York: McGraw Hill; Dorling, D., (1991) The Visualisation of Spatial Structure, , Thesis, Department of Geography, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K; (1995) A New Social Atlas of Britain, , Chichester, U.K.: Wiley; (1996) Area Cartograms: Their Use and Creation.

In comparing two diagrams the following steps are required. First, corresponding points on each diagram are marked, and their co‐ordinates are recorded. Second, the diagrams are scaled and fitted to give the best possible fit; this gives measures of size and shape difference. Third, the displacements of each point relative to its partner on the other diagram are subjected to trend‐surface analysis. The displacements are analysed in terms of linear, quadratic, cubic and higher order trends. Fourth, the differences based on the trends alone can now be estimated. The results on the illustrative examples are discussed, together with the difficulties in applying such methods. The nature of taxonomic (phenetic) affinity is also discussed, with suggestionsfor measuring different components of this concept. The techniques show promise for a wide variety of taxonomic and morphological applications. Copyright © 1967, Wiley Blackwell.

The deconvolution method is iterative and seeks the point-support model that minimizes the difference between the theoretically regularized semivariogram model and the model fitted to areal data. This model is then used in area-to-point (ATP) kriging to map the spatial distribution of the attribute of interest within each geographical unit. The coherence constraint ensures that the weighted average of kriged estimates equals the areal datum. This approach is illustrated using health data (cancer rates aggregated at the county level) and population density surface as a kernel function. Simulations are conducted over two regions with contrasting county geographies: the state of Indiana and four states in the Western United States. In both regions, the deconvolution approach yields a point support semivariogram model that is reasonably close to the semivariogram of simulated point values. The use of this model in ATP kriging yields a more accurate prediction than a naïve point kriging of areal data that simply collapses each county into its geographic centroid. ATP kriging reduces the smoothing effect and is robust with respect to small differences in the point support semivariogram model. Important features of the point-support semivariogram, such as the nugget effect, can never be fully validated from areal data. The user may want to narrow down the set of solutions based on his knowledge of the phenomenon (e.g., set the nugget effect to zero). The approach presented avoids the visual bias associated with the interpretation of choropleth maps and should facilitate the analysis of relationships between variables measured over different spatial supports. © International Association for Mathematical Geology 2007.","Change of support; Choropleth map; Disaggregation; Simulation","Computer simulation; Deconvolution; Estimation; Interpolation; Mathematical models; Statistical methods; deconvolution; geostatistics; interpolation; kriging; simulation; variogram",,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R44CA105819","Acknowledgements This research was funded by grant R44-CA105819-02 from the National Cancer Institute.

Considerable research and theory has been published on these and related topics. In this paper, we will review some of what is known and theorized about spatial cognition and then consider elements of our research program on the acquisition of spatial knowledge. We focus on two intimately related topics. The first is the development of a conceptual model of the knowledge structures and processes associated with acquiring, representing and accessing knowledge of a given environment. The conceptual model forms the basis for a formal computational process model intended as a simulation of actual knowledge and performance in way finding tasks. The second emphasis is an in-depth case study of the acquisition of spatial knowledge. The case study focuses on a single child acquiring knowledge of a lengthy route through an unfamiliar suburban neighborhood. It is presented as an empirical test of certain assumptions embodied within the conceptual model. Before introducing the conceptual model and the case study, we first review the state of current theory and data on spatial cognition and identify four central issues confronting researchers in this field. This review provides a necessary context for describing and evaluating our program of research. The second section of this paper discusses elements of the conceptual model and its relationship to other formal computational models. The third section considers specific hypotheses about the acquisition and representation of spatial knowledge and tests of these hypotheses from the single in-depth case study. The final discussion section of this paper is a reconsideration of the four issues raised in the first section and necessary and proposed extensions of the current research. © 1985 Academic Press Inc.

This involved the specification of zone-design criteria and the implementation of these in a regionalization methodology.

Comparison of geographic phenomena requires a two‐dimensional extension of this technique. In this manner geographic maps can be compared with each other. Possible applications include geometric comparison of ancient and modern maps, or of “mental” maps, or for rubber‐sheeting as used in Geographic Information Systems and in remote sensing. Other applications, for example, in biology for the comparison of shapes of leaves, fish, faces, or skulls after the manner of D'Arcy W. Thompson are also possible, as are higher‐dimensional and multivariate cases. The method implements, and puts into this new context, existing models from the field of cartography. The linear case yields an easy definition of a Pearsonian‐like correlation coefficient. The bidimensional case is richer in mathematical options than is the usual unidimensional version. The curvilinear case is of even greater utility. Here the regression coefficients constitute a spatially varying, but coordinate invariant, second‐order tensor field defined by the matrix of partial derivatives of the transformation. This can be shown to be essentially equivalent to Tissot's Indicatrix, used in cartography to determine the properties of a map projection. In a computer implementation a nonparametric approach allows visualization of the regression by automatically plotting the pair of scatter diagrams, drawing of the displacement field, differentiable smooth interpolation of the warped coordinates and predicted image, by a diagram of the principal strains, and with contour maps of the estimated local angular, areal, and total distortion. 1994 The Ohio State University",,"bidimensional regression; GIS; regression analysis; remote sensing; scatter diagram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aleksandrov, A., Kolmogorov, A., Lavrent'ev, M., (1969) Mathematics: Its Content, Methods, and Meaning, 2. , ch. 7.

The solution of the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for Helm holtzs equation is considered. It is shown, that by an appropriate choice of the fast solver, the capacitance matrix can be generated quite inexpensively. An analogy between capacitance matrix methods and classical potential theory for the solution of Laplaces equation is explored. This analogy suggests a modification of the method in the Dirichlet case. This new formulation leads to well conditioned capacitance matrix equations which can be solved quite efficiently by the conjugate gradient method. A highly accurate solution can, therefore, be obtained at an expense which grows no faster than that for a fast Laplace solver on a rectangle when the mesh size is decreased. © 1976, American Mathematical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angel, E., Bellman, R., Dynamic Programming and Paritat Differential Equations (1972) Math, in Sci.

However, at this resolution the granularity of the data used to represent urban functions makes it difficult to apply traditional analytical and modelling methods. An alternative suggested here is to use kernel density estimation to transform these data from point or area 'objects' into continuous surfaces of spatial densities. The use of this transformation is illustrated by a study in which we attempt to develop a robust, generally applicable methodology for identifying the central areas of UK towns for the purpose of statistical reporting and comparison.

We note that studies using satellites as collection devices yield results indexed by latitude and longitude. Thus it makes sense to assemble the terrestrial arrangement of people in a compatible manner. This alternative is explored here, using latitude/longitude quadrilaterals as bins for population information. This format also has considerable advantages for analytical studies. Ways of achieving the objective include, among others, simple centroid sorts, interpolation, or gridding of polygons. The results to date of putting world boundary coordinates together with estimates of the number of people are described. The estimated 1994 population of 219 countries, subdivided into 19 032 polygons, has been assigned to over six million five minute by five minute quadrilaterals covering the world. These results are available over the Internet. The grid extends from latitude 57°S to 72°N, and covers 360° of longitude. Just under 31% of the (1548 by 4320) grid cells are population. The number of people in these countries is estimated to be 5.6 billion, spread over 132 million km2 of land. Extensions needed include continuous updating, additional social variables, improved interpolation methods, correlation with global change studies, and more detailed information for some parts of the world.",,"demographic method; global population; population distribution; quadrilaterals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tobler, W.; Geography Dept, , Santa Barbara, CA 93106-4060, United States",,,,,,,,,,,"12348289","English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031419476

Their implementation was facilitated by the initial assumption that all geographical units are the same size and shape, which allowed the use of geographic centroids in semivariogram estimation and kriging. Another implicit assumption was that the population at risk is uniformly distributed within each unit. This paper presents a generalization of Poisson kriging whereby the size and shape of administrative units, as well as the population density, is incorporated into the filtering of noisy mortality rates and the creation of isopleth risk maps. An innovative procedure to infer the point-support semivariogram of the risk from aggregated rates (i.e. areal data) is also proposed. Results: The novel methodology is applied to age-adjusted lung and cervix cancer mortality rates recorded for white females in two contrasted county geographies: 1) state of Indiana that consists of 92 counties of fairly similar size and shape, and 2) four states in the Western US (Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah) forming a set of 118 counties that are vastly different geographical units. Area-to-point (ATP) Poisson kriging produces risk surfaces that are less smooth than the maps created by a naïve point kriging of empirical Bayesian smoothed rates. The coherence constraint of ATP kriging also ensures that the population-weighted average of risk estimates within each geographical unit equals the areal data for this unit. Simulation studies showed that the new approach yields more accurate predictions and confidence intervals than point kriging of areal data where all counties are simply collapsed into their respective polygor: centroids. Its benefit over point kriging increases as the county geography becomes more heterogeneous. Conclusion: A major limitation of choropleth maps is the common biased visual perception that larger rural and sparsely populated areas are of greater importance. The approach presented in this paper allows the continuous mapping of mortality risk, while accounting locally for population density and areal data through the coherence constraint. This form of Poisson kriging will facilitate the analysis of relationships between health data and putative covariates that are typically measured over different spatial supports. © 2006 Goovaerts: licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"accuracy; article; cancer mortality; confidence interval; female; geographic distribution; geostatistical analysis; high risk population; human; kriging; lung cancer; mathematical computing; Poisson distribution; population density; population size; risk assessment; simulation; United States; uterine cervix cancer; cluster analysis; computer simulation; epidemiology; geography; lung tumor; mortality; risk; statistical model; statistics; uncertainty; uterine cervix tumor; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Female; Geography; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Models, Statistical; Poisson Distribution; Population Density; Risk; Stochastic Processes; Uncertainty; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R44CA105819",,,,,,,,,,,"Wakefield, J., A critique of statistical aspects of ecological studies in spatial epidemiology (2004) Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 11, pp. 31-54; Croner, C.M., De Cola, L., Visualization of Disease Surveillance Data with Geostatistics UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) Work Session on Methodological Issues Involving Integration of Statistics and Geography: September 2001; Tallinn, , http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2001/09/gis/25.e.pdf, Presented at; Berke, O., Exploratory disease mapping: Kriging the spatial risk function from regional count data (2004) International Journal of Health Geographics, 3, p. 18; Oliver, M.A., Webster, P., Lajaunie, C., Muir, K.R., Parkes, S.E., Cameron, A.H., Stevens, M.C.G., Mann, J.R., Binomial cokriging for estimating and mapping the risk of childhood cancer (1998) IMA Journal of Mathematics Applied in Medicine and Biology, 15, pp. 279-297; Ali, M., Goovaerts, P., Nazia, N., Haq, M.Z., Yunus, M., Enrich, M., Application of Poisson kriging to the mapping of cholera and dysentery incidence in an endemic area of Bangladesh (2006) International Journal of Health Geographics, 5, p. 45; Kelsall, J., Wakefield, J., Modeling spatial variation in disease risk: A geostatistical approach (2002) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 97 (459), pp. 692-701; Choi, K.-M., Serre, M.L., Christakos, G., Efficient mapping of California mortality fields at different spatial scales (2003) Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology, 13, pp. 120-133; Journel, A.G., Huijbregts, C.J., (1978) Mining Geostatistics, , New York: Academic Press; Goovaerts, P., (1997) Geostatistics for Natural Resources Evaluation, , New York: Oxford University Press; Goovaerts, P., Kriging and semivariogram deconvolution in presence of irregular geographical units (2007) Mathematical Geographics, , in review; Gotway, C.A., Young, L.J., Combining incompatible spatial data (2002) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 97, pp. 632-648; Gotway, C.A., Young, L.J., A geostatistical approach to linking geographically-aggregated data from different sources (2004), In Technical report # 2004-012 Department of Statistics, University of Florida; Gotway, C.A., Young, L.J., Change of support: An inter-disciplinary challenge (2005) GeoENV V - Geostatistics for Environmental Applications, pp. 1-13. , In Edited by: Renard Ph, Demougeot-Renard H, Froidevaux R.

In continental areas the predictor is based on the observed correlation of heat flow with age of last tectono-thermal event, and in oceanic regions on the observed relation of heat flow to age of ocean floor. The predictor was used to assign mean heat flow values to 5° × 5° grid areas on the globe, weighted according to the relative area of tectonic provinces represented. A spherical harmonic analysis to degree 12 of the heat flow field yields a mean value of 59 mW m-2, a rms residual of 13 mW m-2, and an amplitude spectrum which decreases gradually and almost monotonically from n = 1. The spherical harmonic representation of the heat flow field is free of the unreal distortions which have characterized earlier analyses based on a geographically sparse data set. Areas with residuals greater than 15 mW m-2 comprise less than 19% of the area of the globe, thus indicating that most heat flow provinces have characteristic dimensions adequately represented in a 12-degree analysis. © 1975.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","ported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Earth Science Section.

When asked to rank order the closeness of toys, preschoolers exaggerated distances between objects separated by opaque or transparent barriers; adults distorted across opaque barriers only. The findings were interpreted as showing that children's spatial representations may rely more than adults' on functional distance and/or that children may have more difficulty than adults keeping many objects in mind simultaneously (integrative processing capacity). The Kosslyn et al. procedure was repeated here with first graders and adults, using either rank ordering techniques or direct distance estimations. Interactions of age and barrier appeared for the rank ordering measure only. Children showed a greater tendency than adults to group their rankings by quadrant. With the distance estimation measure, adults were quantitatively more accurate than children, at least among males; barrier effects interacted with sex and distance, but not age. These findings suggest the importance of integrative processing capacity, and that different dependent measures may tap different processes. © 1982.",,"adolescent; adult; article; child; child development; cognition; decision making; depth perception; discrimination learning; distance perception; female; human; male; orientation; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Development; Cognition; Discrimination Learning; Distance Perception; Female; Human; Judgment; Male; Orientation; Space Perception; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"SO7 RR07084-14; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Research Resources, NCRR: S07RR007084; University of Pittsburgh, Pitt; Pennsylvania State University, PSU","We thank JoAnn Depp. Jane Glassman, Cindy Marks, Susan Periale, and Marg Rennie for help in collecting and coding data, Tim Bunnell for early discussion of the problem and helping to design the space, and the administrators, teachers, parents, and children of the Penns Valley, Pennsylvania school system for their invaluable cooperation.

Bowed serial position curves also showed a sharp dip at the state boundary. Thus, categorization effects were observed. In Exp II-III, artificial materials were used in a similar task. When natural categories were grouped in the states, effects similar to those seen in Exp I occurred. When unrelated words were used as city names, categorization effects occurred only after practice. With practice, then, artificial categories came to function like natural categories.

G. Ravenstein's three articles on migration, the first published one hundred years ago, form the basis for most modern research on migration; if the three articles are collated, his ""laws"" or perhaps more accurately, hypotheses, total eleven. This article considers, briefly, Ravenstein's career, the sources on which his ""laws"" were based and some of the difficulties of interpreting the British Census place of birth data. The bulk of the article reviews subsequent work on his eleven hypotheses with reference to nineteenth-century British internal migration. Subsequent work has confirmed that migration was mainly short distance and that there was relatively little increase in the average distance travelled by migrants until after 1850. His step-by-step hypothesis remains untested, but his belief that most migration was from the countryside to the towns is confirmed as is his identification of counter currents. His ideas on sex and age differentials have been borne out. However, his assumptions about the relative importance of natural increase and migration in the growth of cities and the relative importance of ""push"" and ""pull"" factors in causing migration merit further research. His original hypotheses have for the most part been confirmed. However, the defects of the published data suggest that nineteenth-century migration will not be properly understood until the enumerators' schedules for the century have been analysed. © 1977.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ravenstein, (1871) Census of the British Isles; Ravenstein, Birthplaces and migration (1876) Geographical Magazine, 3, pp. 173-177; Ravenstein, Birthplaces and migration (1876) Geographical Magazine, 3, pp. 201-206; Ravenstein, Birthplaces and migration (1876) Geographical Magazine, 3, pp. 229-233; Ravenstein, The laws of migration (1885) Journal of the Statistical Society, 48, pp. 167-227; Ravenstein, The laws of migration (1889) Journal of the Statistical Society, 52, pp. 214-301; Lee, A theory of migration (1969) Migration, pp. 282-297. , J.A.

Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory, concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed.",,"animal; article; biological model; depth perception; physiology; vision; visual system; visual system function; Animals; Depth Perception; Models, Biological; Ocular Physiology; Visual Pathways; Visual Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grimson, W.E.",,,,,,,,09628436,,,"6127732","English","Philos.

This should also apply when areal units are used as the spatial data collection entity. Previous work has shown that some analysis procedures do not yield the same results under alternate areal aggregations, but some of these studies have used measures known to be inappropriate for spatial data, eg, Pearsonian correlation instead of cross-spectral analysis. And there are some methods of analysis which do seem to yield frame invariant results, especially under alternate partitionings of the geographic space. It is proposed that all methods of spatial analysis be examined for the invariance of their conclusions under alternative spatial partitionings, and that only those methods be allowed which show such invariance. -from Author",,"geographic space; spatial analysis; spatial coordinate; spatial partitioning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goodchild M.Gopal S.",,"Taylor & Francis",,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024909349

Geographers can now consider a general form of automated geography which integrates all of the new techniques into an analytical whole. Computer cartography, Computer graphics, digital remote sensing, geographic Information Systems, spatial statis- tics, and quantitative spatial modeling can be combined eclectically with traditional manual techniques to address geographic Problems that are too large and complex for manual treatment alone. Small Systems are widely available to facilitate small, less complex Problems. Automation can assist in all forms of geography—scientific and humanistic, nomothetic and idiographic, basic and applied—but its adoption is likely to be highest among applied scientists. The immediate challenge is to prepare for a major shift toward Computer instruction and automated geography in the late 1980s. Long term effects will include improved contributions by geographers to national and international policy analyses, a greater emphasis on team-work and sharing, stronger ties with other disciplines, and a generally more viable discipline. © 1983 by Association of American Geographers.","Automation; Cartography; Computers; Geography; Graphics; Spatial","analytical methods; computer technology; spatial analysis",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","* I am indebted to Edward L.

The plots, applied to a data matrix before clustering and to the rearranged matrix after clustering, show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any distinctive clusters. A well-known set of data consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis. © 1973, ACM.

The inadequacies of Freudian hypotheses are highlighted, and attention is directed to Daseinanalysis, which stays close to the data. This perspective focuses attention upon the phenomenological tradition, and suggests that certain mathematical frameworks in human geography are inappropriate. The adequacy of a priori models is also questioned from a Heideggerian perspective, and more general qualitative algebras are suggested to replace the distorted functional thinking inherited from the physical sciences. © 1981, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Yet the past ten years have witnessed geographers' increasing intellectual engagement with GIS and cartography. This essay recaps the recent intellectual discourses on GIS and cartography and speculates on possible development in the near future. Geocomputation, spatially integrated social sciences, social informatics, information ecology, and humanistic GIScience are identified as five areas of intensive new research, and it is argued that creative imaginations under the milieu of the “third culture” are urgently needed to address the challenging issues in this new technological era. Whether geography will become an intellectually more vibrant discipline hinges on the extent to which we can rekindle geographic imaginations in this computer age via GIScience to address issues of great societal concern. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper describes the commonly encountered situation associated with asymptotic non-normality for null distributions of MRPP statistics which does not depend on the underlying multivariate distribution. In addition, this paper establishes the existence of a non-degenerate underlying distribution for which the null distributions of MRPP statistic are asymptotically non-normal for essentially all size structur< configurations. It is known that MRPP statistics are symmetric versions of a broader class of statistics, most of which are asymmetric. Because of the non-normality associated with null distributions of MRPP statistics, this paper includes necessary results for inferences based on the exact first three moments oi any statistic in this broader class (analogous to existing results for MRPP statistics). © 1979 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

The evolution of the model is summarized and a general form is defined. The models are compared as regards certain structural properties — biproportionality, scale, endogeny, consistency, and spatial interaction. The various macro and micro approaches to deriving or interpreting gravity models are reviewed. Problems and limitations of each approach are noted, and their basic theoretical foundations are criticized. Finally, the general trend of gravity model development is discussed. © 1979, Sage Publications.

Ravenstein’s 1885 paper also includes a map of “Currents of Migration,” not mentioned in the text, which this article examines for its impacts on the study of migration. Warren Thornthwaite (1934) also compared migration to currents, but did not pursue this analogy in subsequent work. Others have used similar terminology, and examination of more recent migration studies suggests that they may yield new laws. © 1995 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc.

More often than not, data have been collected at different geographic scales, and each of the scales may be different from the one of interest. Geographic information systems effortlessly handle these types of problems through raster and geoprocessing operations based on proportional allocation and centroid smoothing techniques. However, these techniques do not provide a measure of uncertainty in the estimates and lack the ability to incorporate important covariate information that may be used to improve the estimates. They also often ignore the different spatial supports (e.g., shape and orientation) of the data. On the other hand, statistical solutions to change-of-support problems are rather specific and difficult to implement. In this article, we present a general geostatistical framework for linking geographic data from different sources. This framework incorporates aggregation and disaggregation of spatial data, as well as prediction problems involving overlapping geographic units. It explicitly incorporates the supports of the data, can adjust for covariate values measured on different spatial units at different scales, provides a measure of uncertainty for the resulting predictions, and is computationally feasible within a GIS. The new framework we develop also includes a new approach for simultaneous estimation of mean and covariance functions from aggregated data using generalized estimating equations. © 2007 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America.","Change-of-support; Disaggregation; Ecological inference; Generalized estimating equations; Modifiable areal unit problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bracken, I., Martin, D., The Generation of Spatial Population Distributions from Census Centroid Data (1989) Environment and Planning A, 21, pp. 537-543; Brillinger, D.R., Spatial-Temporal Modeling of Spatially Aggregate Birth Data (1990) Survey Methodology, 16, pp. 255-269; Brillinger, D.R., Examples of Scientific Problems and Data Analyses in Demography, Neurophysiology, and Seismology (1994) Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 3, pp. 1-22; Chilès, J.P., Delfiner, P., (1999) Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty, , New York: Wiley; Cressie, N., Fitting Variogram Models by Weighted Least Squares (1985) Journal of the International Association for Mathematical Geology, 17, pp. 563-586; Cressie, N., (1993) Statistics for Spatial Data, , New York: Wiley; Cressie, N., Change of Support and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (1996) Geographical Systems, 3, pp. 159-180; Flowerdew, R., Green, M., Developments in Areal Interpolating Methods and GIS (1992) Annals of Regional Science, 26, pp. 67-78; Flowerdew, R., Green, M., Areal Interpolation and Types of Data (1994) Spatial Analysis and GIS, pp. 121-145. , eds.

In the applications considered, a data analysis scheme is assumed to reconstruct in matrix form the given data set (represented as a proximity matrix) based on some specific model or procedure. Thus, an evaluation of the adequacy of reconstruction can be developed by comparing matrices, one containing the original proximities and the second containing the reconstructed values. Possible applications in multidimensional scaling, clustering, and related contexts are emphasized using four broad categories: (a) Given two different reconstructions based on a single data set, does either represent the data significantly better than the other? (b) Given two reconstructions based on a single data set using two different procedures (or possibly, two distinct data sets and a common method), is either reconstruction significantly closer to a particular theoretical structure that is assumed to underlie the data (where the latter is also represented in matrix form)? (c) Given two theoretical structures and one reconstruction based on a single data set, does either represent the reconstruction better than the other? (d) Given a single reconstruction based on one data set, is the information present in the data accounted for satisfactorily by the reconstruction? In all cases, these tasks can be approached by a nonparametric procedure that assesses the similarity in pattern between two appropriately defined matrices. The latter are obtained from the original data, the reconstructions, and/or the theoretical structures. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the more general discussion. © 1981.",,,,,,,"National Institute of Justice, NIJ: 80-IJ-CX-0061, NSF-SOC-77","Partial support for this research was supplied under NIJ Grant 80-IJ-CX-0061 and NSF-SOC-77. 28227.

If moving average (or some other) techniques are then applied, slopes may be zero at data points; extrema may fall at data points exclusively; or surfaces may not pass through data points. An alternative method is proposed whereby a map area is automatically divided into suitable triangular domains with a data point at each vertex. Surface estimation and contour plotting are then performed independently for each triangle using a measured or best-fit plane associated with each data point. The approach requires the utilization of three non-original aspects: 1) the derivation of a local homogeneous ""area"" coordinate system for any arbitrary triangle; 2) the construction of a data-structure linking each triangular domain with its three neighbouring triangles and three associated data points, and 3) the use of a ""conforming"" triangular finite-element interpolating function. Use of the first two of these concepts permits the economic generation and optimization of a triangular mesh from a set of data points. Optimization criteria used to define the ""best"" triangular partition are described in some detail, along with computer timing for this step. Use of the first and third concepts permits the interpolation of a smooth surface over the whole map area even though each triangular element is estimated and plotted independently. The requirements for a suitable interpolating function are discussed, and an interpolant is suggested that preserves elevation and slope at each data point as well as elevation and slope continuity between domains. Extrema need not be located at data points but are constrained by their associated planes. Contour line segments are produced by division of each triangle into N2 sub-triangles, elevation estimation at each resulting node, and linear interpolation and plotting withing each sub-triangle. Resolution is then a function of N and local data point density. Extension of the method to higher dimensions is briefly discussed.","Cartography; Contour mapping; Finite elements; Graphical data structures; Homogeneous coordinates; Interpolation; Partitioning; Random data points; Surface display; Triangular elements; Triangular mesh","Computational mechanics; Data structures; Finite element method; Interactive computer graphics; Interpolation; Mapping; Maps; Mesh generation; Contour mapping; Homogeneous coordinates; Partitioning; Random data; Surface displays; Triangular elements; Triangular meshes; Computer graphics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bengtsson, B.F., Nordbeck, S., Construction of isarithms and isarithmic maps by computers (1964) B.

For the regions where such information is unavailable or poor, it is important to develop procedures for the estimation of gravity anomalies, based on existing data sources. This paper examines the possibility of combining low‐degree satellite‐derived geopotential models with the harmonic coefficients of the topographic‐isostatic potential implied by the Airy/Heiskanen isostatic hypothesis. The compilation of a new global topographic database that provides additional information pertaining to terrain type classification, ice coverage etc., is discussed first. Then the rigorous formulation for the determination of harmonic coefficients of the topographic‐isostatic potential is extended to account for the various terrain types. This formulation, and a series expansion approach are implemented to determine topographic‐isostatic coefficient sets complete to degree and order 360. These coefficients are then combined with satellite‐derived models (GEM‐T1/T2) to estimate 1°× 1° mean gravity anomalies. Comparisons of the estimated anomalies with observed values, as well as with anomalies derived from satellite altimetry, indicated the following. (a) Optimum results are obtained when the satellite models are used to degree 36 and the topographic‐isostatic coefficients from 37 onwards. For example, when GEM‐T2 to degree 36 is combined with the topographic‐isostatic coefficients from 37 to 180, the root mean square (rms) anomaly difference with 6237 1°× 1° terrestrial values having a standard deviation less than 10 mgals, was ±18 mgals, which should be compared to the rms value of the terrestrial anomalies which was about ±27 mgals. The use of GEM‐T2 alone up to degree 36 yields an rms discrepancy with the same terrestrial values of the order of ±22 mgal. (b) The effect of ice is significant and improves the quality of the estimated anomalies in polar regions where very limited gravity material exists. (c) The overall accuracy of the estimated anomalies is about equal to the overall accuracy of existing geophysically predicted anomalies. However, the use of the satellite model for the low degrees in the current procedure, may resolve problems associated with regional biases detected in the geophysical anomalies.

The chessboard distance metric is shown to be particularly suitable for the quadtree. A chessboard distance transform for a quadtree is defined as the minimum distance in the plane from each BLACK node to the border of a WHITE node. An algorithm is presented which computes this transform by only examining the BLACK node's adjacent and abutting neighbors and their progeny. However, unlike prior work with quadtrees, computation of the distance transform requires a capability of finding neighbors in the diagonal direction rather than merely in the horizontal and vertical directions. The algorithm's average execution time is proportional to the number of leaf nodes in the quadtree. © 1982 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","Distance transforms; image processing; pattern recognition; quadtrees","IMAGE PROCESSING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., (1973) Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, , New York: Wiley-Interscience; Dyer, C.R., Rosenfeld, A., Samet, H., Region representation: Boundary codes from quadtrees (1980) Commun.

Two main methods of population distribution are employed: (1) a method based on redistribution from enumeration district (ED) and postcode centroids, and (2) a method based on dasymetric redistribution of ED population counts to suitable land cover zones from classified remotely sensed imagery. Refinements have been made to the centroid redistribution algorithm to accommodate an empirical measure of dispersion, and to allow redistribution in an anisotropic form. These refinements are evaluated against each other and the dasymetric method. The results suggest that all of the methods perform best in urban areas, and that while the refinements may improve the statistical performance of the models, this is at the expense of reduced spatial detail. In general, the techniques are highly sensitive to the spatial and population resolution of the input data.",,"census; modeling; performance assessment; population distribution; remote sensing; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, T.C., Gatrell, A.C., (1995) Interactive Spatial Data Analysis, , Harlow, Longman; Barr, R., Mapping and spatial analysis (1993) The 1991 Census User's Guide, pp. 248-268. , In Dale A and Marsh C (eds); London, HMSO; Bracken, I., Martin, D., The generation of spatial population distributions from census centroid data (1989) Environment and Planning A, 21, pp. 537-543; Bracken, I., Martin, D., Linkage of the 1981 and 1991 Censuses using surface modelling concepts (1995) Environment and Planning A, 27, pp. 379-390; Brainard, J.S., Lovett, A.A., Parfitt, J., Assessing hazardous-waste transport risks using a GIS (1996) International Journal of Geographical Information Systems, 10, pp. 831-849; (1994) Northern Ireland 1991 Census of Population Small Area Statistics: Guide 1 - Introductory Notes and Table Outlines, , Belfast, Census Office for Northern Ireland; Cresswell, P., Customized and proprietary GIS: Past, present and future (1995) GIS for Business and Service Planning, pp. 192-226. , In Longley P and Clarke G (eds); Cambridge, GeoInformation International; Denham, C., Census geography: I an overview (1993) The 1991 Census User's Guide, pp. 52-69. , In Dale A and Marsh C (eds); London, HMSO; Dorling, D., Map design for census mapping (1993) Cartographic Journal, 30, pp. 167-183; Fisher, P.F., Langford, M., Modelling the errors in areal interpolation between zonal systems by Monte Carlo simulation (1995) Environment and Planning A, 27, pp. 211-224; Fisher, P.F., Langford, M., Modelling sensitivity to accuracy in classified imagery: A study of areal interpolation (1996) The Professional Geographer, 48, pp. 299-309; Flowerdew, R., Green, M., Data integration: Statistical methods for transferring data between zonal systems (1991) Handling Geographical Information: Methodology and Potential Applications, pp. 38-54. , In Masser I and Blakemore M (eds); London, Longman; Goodchild, M.F., Anselin, L., Deichmann, U., A framework for the areal interpolation of socioeconomic data (1993) Environment and Planning A, 25, pp. 383-397; Langford, M., Unwin, D.J., Generating and mapping population density surfaces within a geographical information system (1994) Cartographic Journal, 31, pp. 21-26; Langford, M., Maguire, D.J., Unwin, D.J., The area transform problem: Estimating population using remote sensing in a GIS framework (1991) Handling Geographical Information: Methodology and Potential Applications, pp. 55-77. , In Masser I and Blakemore M (eds); London, Longman; Lovett, A.A., Brainard, J.S., Bateman, I.J., Improving benefit transfer demand functions: A GIS approach (1997) Journal of Environmental Management, 51, pp. 373-389; Martin, D., Mapping population data from zone centroid locations (1989) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 14, pp. 90-97; Martin, D., An assessment of surface and zonal models of population (1996) International Journal of Geographical Information Systems, 10, pp. 973-989; Martin, D., Census output areas: From concept to prototype (1998) Population Trends, 94, pp. 19-24; Mesev, V., The use of census data in urban image classification (1998) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 64, pp. 431-438; Mesev, V., Longley, P., Batty, M., RS-GIS: Spatial distributions from remote imagery (1996) Spatial Analysis: Modelling in a GIS Environment, pp. 123-148. , In Longley P and Batty M (eds); Cambridge, GeoInformation International; Okabe, A., Sadahiro, Y., Variation in count data transferred from a set of irregular zones to a set of regular zones through the point-in-polygon method (1997) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 11, pp. 93-106; (1992) ED/Postcode Directory: Prospectus, , Fareham, OPCS Census User Guide Note 26; Raper, J.F., Rhind, D.W., Shepherd, J.W., (1992) Postcodes: The New Geography, , Harlow, Longman; Robinson, J.M., Zubrow, E., Restoring continuity: Exploration of techniques for reconstructing the spatial distribution underlying polygonized data (1997) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 11, pp. 633-648; Tobler, W.R., Smooth pycnophylactic interpolation for geographical regions (1979) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, pp. 519-530; Tobler, W.R., Linear pycnophylactic reallocation: Comment on a paper by D Martin (1999) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 31, pp. 85-90; Wright, J.K., A method of mapping densities of population with Cape Cod as an example (1936) Geographical Review, 26, pp. 103-110",,,,,,,,,13611682,,,,"English","Trans.

It is now generally accepted that the study of how maps convey knowledge to a recipient, and therefore the study of the percipient as well as the process, are important areas of research. Various models of communication systems are analysed from the point of view of the inputs and transformations involved. The element of “noise”, characteristic of all systems, is examined as it relates to the map. The problem of assessing the amount of information included in a map and the efficiency with which geographical knowledge is evoked in a percipient is reviewed. Because a map is a two-dimensional presentation it is a very different form of communication from the one-dimensional linear forms that depend upon a temporal sequence, and consequently, the techniques of information theory are judged not to be directly applicable. © 1975 The British Cartographic Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balasubramanyan, V., Application of Information Theory to Maps (1971) International Yearbook of Cartography, 11, pp. 177-181;

Of the mathematical class, piecewise surfaces are often preferable to continuous surfaces. Because of their mathematical simplicity, polynomials have been employed extensively. The methods of determining orthogonal, non-orthogonal and weighted polynomials are given and their relative merits discussed. The two most commonly employed numerical surfaces are the weighted-average and finite-difference techniques. The former is simple and rapid to calculate, and generally produces good results for data with low gradients and constant density. The potential of the latter is relatively unexplored; however, the iterative nature of the solution indicates its suitability to computer application. Most practical interpolation consists of a combination of several methods. The problem of computer contouring can be considered separately in terms of the calculation of the location of the individual line segments, and the logic of the drawing of all the segments. Both straight and curved line segments have been employed. Much more preferable, but more difficult, is the production of continuous curved lines. The drawing of contours by the grid-scan and contour-following techniques is described, and advantages of each outlined. In practice, the choice of an interpolation and a contouring method depends on the nature and ultimate purpose of the data, and the particular computer hardware configuration available. © 1970.",,"COMPUTERS, DATA PROCESSING; DATA; GEOXA; MAPS AND MAPPING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahlberg, Nilson, Walsh, (1967) The Theory of Splines and their Applications, p. 284. , Academic Press, New York, N.Y; Armbrust, A contour generator (1968) Paper presented at SWAP-14 Conference, , April.1968; Batcha, Reese, Surface determination and automatic contouring for mineral exploration, extraction and processing (1964) Colo.

Furthermore we show that the magnitude of classification errors produced by ML increases moving from fine to coarse resolutions, but the increase is moderated by the presence of spatial dependency among pixels. On the other hand the spatial distribution of classification errors is shown to be only marginally affected by the mapping resolution chosen. © 1996 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) Amsterdam B.

Synthetic population techniques have been devised and are used as a viable alternative to the collection of microdata that normally are inaccessible because of confidentiality concerns or incomplete because of high acquisition costs. The two most widely discussed synthetic techniques are the synthetic reconstruction method (IPFSR), which makes use of iterative proportional fitting (IPF) techniques, and the combinatorial optimization (CO) method. Both methods are described in this article and then evaluated in terms of their ability to recreate a known population of firms, using limited data extracted from the parent population of the firms. Testing a synthetic population against a known population is seldom done, because obtaining an entire population usually is too difficult. The case presented here uses a small, complete population of firms for the City of Hamilton, Ontario, for the year 1990; firm attributes compiled are number of employees, 3-digit standard industrial classification, and geographic location. Results are summarized for experiments based upon various combinations of sample size and tabulation detail designed to maximize the accuracy of resulting synthetic populations while holding input data costs to a minimum. The output from both methods indicates that increases in sample size and tabulation detail result in higher quality synthetic populations, although the quality of the generated population is more sensitive to increases in tabular detail. Finally, most tests conducted with the created synthetic populations suggest that the CO method is superior to the IPFSR method. © 2009 by The Ohio State University.",,"data acquisition; numerical method; optimization; population dynamics; population estimation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arentze, T., Timmermans, H., Hofman, F., ""Creating Synthetic Household Populations: Problems and Approach"" (2007) TRB 2007 Annual Meeting Proceedings, , Washington, DC; Ballas, D., Clarke, G., Dorling, D., Eyre, H., Thomas, B., Rossiter, D., ""SimBritain: A Spatial Microsimulation Approach to Population Dynamics"" (2005) Population, Space and Place, 11, pp. 13-34; Beckman, R.J., Baggerly, K.A., McKay, M.D., ""Creating Synthetic Baseline Populations"" (1996) Transportation Research A, 30 (6), pp. 415-429; Deming, W.E., Stephan, F.F., ""On a Least Squares Adjustment of a Sampled Frequency Table When the Expected Marginal Tables are Known"" (1940) Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 11, pp. 427-444; Frick, M., Axhausen, K., ""Generating Synthetic Populations using IPF and Monte Carlo Techniques: Some New Results"" (2004) Swiss Transport Research Conference, , Paper presented at the Ascona, Switzerland.

The effects of a synthetic juvenile hormone analog on cellular metamorphosis (here regarded as an example of cellular differentiation) were analyzed at two levels: 1. A. Effects on cuticle secreted by individual cells 1.1. 1. Potent doses (1.25 μg of the crude extract) when injected early in the last molt of Oncopeltus caused complete inhibition of metamorphosis and curtailed the molt cycle. 1.2. 2. After injection of the same dose at 27 and 49 hours after ecdysis, larval cuticle was formed; but injection at 64 and 74 hours produced a series of adult/larval intermediate insects whose abdominal integument consisted of intermediate cells. The whole insect was affected and the epidermal cells responded uniformly. A continuous series of integuments showing increasing cellular metamorphosis was obtained. 1.3. 3. When threshold doses (0.06 μg) of the hormone were injected early in the molt, only the epidermis was affected and the response of the epidermal cells was heterogeneous, resulting in mosaic insects. 2. B. Effects on the hair pattern During metamorphosis in Oncopeltus evenly spaced hairs develop. These structures are distinct from, and much denser than, the larval bristles. Their development is sensitive to the juvenile hormone. 2.1. 1. Injection of potent doses of juvenile hormone within a few hours of the previous ecdysis completely suppressed hair development. After this time and up until 64 hours after ecdysis hair development was only partially reduced, even though the cuticle secreted was completely larval by other criteria. There was no effect on hair density after 64 hours, even though the visible cytological events associated with hair differentiation do not begin until 70 hours. 2.2. 2. The intermediates could be arranged in a continuous series of increasing hair density. The uniformity of distribution was measured quantitatively and found to improve with density. 2.3. 3. Mitomycin C was injected and found to disrupt hair development independently from juvenile hormone, probably by direct interference with hair development. 2.4. 4. The hair and bristle pattern was analyzed quantitatively according to the method of Claxton (1964): the results supported the adoption of the Wigglesworth model for bristle development as a working hypothesis. Within the terms of this model, the juvenile hormone was shown to maintain the threshold of epidermal cells to the bristle-forming substance, a threshold which falls during normal cellular metamorphosis. 2.5. 5. The process of cellular metamorphosis and differentiation in this system is considered to be a gradual one, which can be halted by juvenile hormone. The development of small numbers of evenly spaced hairs in intermediates is regarded as an expression of partial metamorphosis or differentiation. © 1969.",,"hormone; mitomycin; article; cell differentiation; cytology; drug effect; growth, development and aging; hair; injection; insect; metamorphosis; skin; Cell Differentiation; Hair; Injections; Insects; Invertebrate Hormones; Metamorphosis, Biological; Mitomycins; Skin",,"mitomycin, 1404-00-8; Invertebrate Hormones; Mitomycins",,,"National Science Foundation: GB4847X; Commonwealth Fund; U.S. Public Health Service: GM09960; Agricultural Research Council","I thank Professors D.

This paper examines the role of specialization within and between disciplines, with special reference to geography, as a response to the complexity of knowledge and of scientific activity, and as a phenomenon of social organization. The scale and basis of organization of the specialty groups are seen as responses to needs for communication and survival. Natural and empirical views of the organization of disciplines and other academic divisions within the field of knowledge, and of the processes operating on individual career paths, are discussed. The empirical (or pragmatic) view provides the basis for analyzing the membership of AAG specialty groups to determine the structure of the current discipline and the trends to which it is subject. A multidimensional scaling and an elementary linkage analysis of the cross memberships of specialty groups for 1984 show patterns of affinity and divergence of topical interest and of general research paradigms. The revealed cores of the discipline confirm the earth-science, man-land and spatial traditions identified by Pattison (1964). In contrast, the area-studies tradition does not display any unified core, but links to the general body of geography through systematic concerns. Applied geography, historical geography and cartography are most central to the structuring of specialty group memberships and appear to be prominent sources of unity for those groups that represent the different traditions. A diversity-of-interest measure, based on an information statistic, reveals that sociodemographic (age and sex), institutional (Ph.D.-granting departments), and technological factors also play significant roles in structuring the pattern of specialization. © 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Hrozny discovered the source of the ""Cappadocian"" tablets near the village of Kültepe (38° 44′ N, 35° 34′ E). These cuneiform tablets provide a foundation for study of the pre-Hittite (circa 1940 BC to 1740 BC) network of Assyrian merchant colonies in Bronze Age Anatolia1. Bilgic2 has published the names of 119 towns active in this exchange, as evidenced by their citation on a tablet. The exact location of most of these sites is not known, and historical and archaeological investigations would be greatly facilitated if they could be found. We have used Bilgic's compilation to estimate the geographical position of several of the towns, in the sense of Bunge3, which is conditional on several assumptions. We invoke assumptions to enhance the analysis by applying the leverage obtained from geographical theory. We assume, for example, that mathematical models based on contemporary (largely western) data have a temporally and geographically invariant structure and can be applied to the Cappadocian situation. Our approach differs from several previous attempts1,2,4, to which it should be considered complementary rather than competitive. For example, we do not require the existence of itineraries; the mere mention of two town names on the same tablet is taken to define a relation between these towns. We recognize that one of the simplest geographical relations is distance and attempt to convert the tabular data into geographical distances. If this is possible then it is an almost routine matter to convert these distances into relative positions. Thus it may be possible to specify the actual locations of the towns; that is, to predict their latitude and longitude. The simplest model asserts that places which are mentioned together frequently are probably closer together than are places which are not mentioned together frequently. This spatial decay is similar to the temporal decay of linguistic relations postulated in glottochronology5, or of isotopic changes used in radiocarbon dating6. Our procedure attempts to estimate spatial, rather than temporal, origins and can be considered the geographical equivalent to these methods. It also has comparable limitations. We know of no previous use of the procedure presented here. ©1971 Nature Publishing Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Garelli, P., (1963) Les Assyriens en Cappadoce, , Maisonneuve, Paris; Bilgic, E., (1951) Arch.

If we are interested in testing the hypothesis H:ρ12=ρ13 against appropriate alternatives under a variety of assumptions about the form of the trivariate distribution, but with no further restrictions on Σ, we could use one of the many asymptotic or conditional procedures that are available; see, for example, Aitkin, Nelson &amp; Reinfurt (1968), Corsten (1970) and Dunn &amp; Clark (1969). On the other hand, an exact, small-sample, unconditional test of H does not appear to be tractable for this general Σ. We show that by placing a mild restriction on Σ, such a small-sample test of H can be based on a simple, single product-moment correlation coefficient between the variables X1 and X3-X2 provided that the conditional distribution of X1 given X3-X2, is normal. © 1976 Biometrika Trust.","Covariance matrices; Equality of regressions; Exact tests; Related correlation coefficients","regression; statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wolfe, D.A.; Department of Statistics, United States",,,,,,,,00063444,,BIOKA,,"English","Biometrika",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041987748

Social theorists have discussed how geospatial technologies (GSTs) are things to be feared. They point to the loss of privacy, to the use of technologies in warfare, and to the growth of surveillance. I explore this understanding and the ""evil"" side of geospatial technologies, and I present the alternative view - a view of these technologies as harbingers of hope. GSTs have a positive role to play in environmental protection, in health, and in social justice. There is a need for the involvement of more human geographers in technological development in order to allow for critical analyses of the social impacts generated by these technologies. Only by shining the spotlight of critical geographical analyses on development of GSTs, and their uses, can we ensure that technological development is kept on a path of positive development. This addition of the social to the technological is imperative and requires an active role on the part of geographers. Geographers, and geography as a discipline, are well suited to this challenge, and as islands of researchers coalesce into a synergistic ""mainland community"" of cooperative investigation into GSTs the result will be a well-woven fabric of socially responsible technology. © 2007 by Association of American Geographers.","Geospatial technologies; GIS; Hope and fear; Surveillance","GIS; social impact; social theory; technological development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2004) US Critical Infrastructure, , http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/buzz/stories/s1047647.htm, Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

To do this, the model recursively tessellates a regular solid, either an octahedron or an icosahedron, into equilateral triangular facets.

The models are based on the assumption that polymeric chains form bridges between the fibrils, thereby providing the long range interactions responsible for the quasi-ordered spatial disposition of the fibrils. The theory is applied to rabbit cornea for which an empirical radial distribution has been obtained previously by analysis of electron micrographs. General agreement is found between theory and experiment for parameter values that are thought to be representative of stroma. The analysis constitutes a step toward the development of the physical basis of the ultrastructure of connective tissue and the way in which that structure affects physiological behavior. © 1968 N.

At a time when the claim can be made that other facets of the theory are equally well out of touch with reality, some will undoubtedly conclude that these other facets deserve prior attention. They include entrepreneurial behavior and consumer spatial behaviorin fact, the whole marketing system is so naively treated by ""classical"" theory. Aside from potential applications to central place work, the algorithm is applicable to many current spatial servicing problems. In this respect it may serve as a normative tool in spatial planning. It has further been suggested that only minor modifications are necessary to extend the range of applications from the present emphasis on distributing points to serve equal population-size areas to other cases where distance constraints are imposed for the farthest person to be serviced; or where people are voluntarily choosing service points according to a space-preference function; or where the number of people to be served varies with population density; or where areas encompassing equal travel-time limits or travel-cost limits are desired. In all such cases, the fundamental logic and strategy of manipulating a set of points to best represent a set of local interpoint distances are identical. It is at this level that the isomorphism with multidimensional scaling algorithms which provided the stimulus for this work is to be found. © 1972 The Regional Science Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baskin, C.W., (1966) W.

The systems of knowledge production developed for analytical cartography in its social context are summarized and are found to show a powerful dependence on a working relationship between academia, industry, government, and the intelligence mapping community. Current research trends in analytical cartography, including the organization of research, its institutions, and its priorities, are discussed, and it is proposed that declassifying the ""missing pool"" of analytical cartographic research literature could be of great benefit in the future. The four-way academic/industrial/government/intelligence partnership is seen as an opportune direction forward for analytical cartography. The next generational shift in the center of the discipline may occur in networks that even Waldo Tobler did not anticipate.","Analytical cartography; Cold war; CORONA; Military intelligence; SAGE","analytical method; cartography; historical perspective; Computer control systems; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Geographic information systems; Information science; Military applications; Social aspects; Analytical cartography; Cold war; Geographic information science; Military intelligence; Social context; Sociotechnical ensemble; Mapping",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SBR-9810440; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Army Research Office, ARO","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Partial support for this project from the National Science Foundation (SBR-9810440) is gratefully acknowledged. Thanks to Waldo Toble1~ who read and commented on an early version of this paper, and to the two anonymous reviewers for their productive suggestions.","Despite the earlier Cold War emphasis on progress in classified cartography programs, with the end of the Cold War, academic research and applications have assumed more central roles in the development of contemporary analytical cartography. A more appropriate model for the next decade might be a three-way collaboration-between government, industry and the academia-or the Leslie (1993) model. This is obviously more important than ever without the over-riding dominance of national security so central to the Cold War. Some institutions are responding to this need. For example, the recent request for proposals from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's NURI (NlMA-University Research Initiative) has involved collaborative identification of research foci of maximum mutual benefit, especially between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).","to extract three-dimensional information about the terrain, buildings, etc. While the principles of stereo imaging had been understood for over a century, CORONA demanded systems that could provide both accuracy and rapid throughput. Once the analog equipment of the early CORONA program gave way to computer-assisted and eventually digital processing, new possibilities for using terrain elevation data became evident. The need for an understanding of digital topography led to research outside of CORONA, much of it funded by the U.S. Army Research Office. Waldo Tobler later worked on terrain analysis methods, using principles from image processing that he had learned from Azriel Rosenfeld (Tobler 1968; 1999). As Tobler stated in Analytical Cartography, he ""wished to emphasize that mathematical methods are involved, but also that an objective is the solution of concrete problems"" (Tobler 1976). One great concrete problem was in accurate topographic map production, and CORONA itself played a major role in topographic mapping at the United States Geological Survey and elsewhere (Baclawski 1997). Out of this work came the first space-based analytical photogrammetry (and cartography) of the stereo model and its derivation (Selander 1997), and also the methods, equipment, experience and infrastructure for ""industrial-scale"" use of the data (Light 1971). Light stated ""that the 'pixel concept' shows great promise for reduction of topographic imagery and information to usable, storable, retrievable, displayable form."" The familiar Digital Elevation Models and Triangulated Irregular Networks evolved for these and earlier data types and became the basis for enormous digital ""librar-ies."" The legacy of these pioneering programs includes contemporary national and global digital elevation coverages (Gittings 1999). Light's metaphor of the ""image of the world in a barrel,"" based on the nickname devised by the staff of the U.S. Army Topographic Command for a cylindrically shaped mass storage device, lives on a third of a century later in the latest concept definitions of the Digital Earth project. This brief consideration of the influences that shaped the origins of analytical cartography has focussed on the government as the motivator for change within cartography. Generally speaking, academic depart-ments were slow to adapt to the new cartography, and the emerging field of GIS was even slower. This may have been partly due to the fact that the first generation of graduates of analytical cartography found careers in government agencies, especially such mapping agen-cies as the Defense Mapping Agency and its separate predecessor service-level constituences, the United States Geological Survey, the CIA and the National",,,,,,,,"Baclawski, J.A., Corona: The foundation for a mapmaking revolution (1997) CORONA: Between the Sun and the Earth.

Some packages provide additional options for the interpolation from 3D line objects, for example surface-specific lines, or contour lines digitized from topographic maps. Demographic, social and economic data can also be used to construct and display smooth surfaces. The variables are usually published as sums for polygonal units, such as the number of inhabitants in communities or counties. In the case of point and line objects the geometric properties have to be maintained in the interpolated surface. For polygon-based data the geometric properties of the polygon boundary and the volume should be preserved, avoiding redistribution of parts of the volume to neighboring units during interpolation. The pycnophylactic interpolation method computes a continuous surface from polygon-based data and simultaneously enforces volume preservation in the polygons.

The arithmetic mean divides a numerical array into two classes and the means of each of these two map classes yield four map classes with smaller intervals. Repeating the process yields additional means and additional classes with smaller intervals. The result is a series of map classes derived from a nested hierarchy of means; the means are the class limits and also the points of minimum variance, that is, the most representative points for the data values which they classify. The class intervals vary according to the degree of uniformity (in the univariate sense) of the numerical array which is classified for mapping. Thus, class intervals are small in the modal portions of a distribution and large in the tails.

Such an estimate is the plainest possible continuous function, thus in a sense eliminating details that are irrelevant or unsupported by data. The answer is found from the solution of the following variational problem: Determine the function that reproduces the data, has the smallest gradient (in the square norm sense), and has a gradient that vanishes at large distances from the observations. The generalized covariance functions are shown to be the Green's functions for the free-space Laplace equation: the linear distance, in one dimension; the logarithmic distance in two dimensions; and the inverse distance in three dimensions. It is demonstrated that they are appropriate covariance functions for intrinsic random fields, a modification is proposed to facilitate numerical implementation, and a couple of examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the methodology.",,"covariance analysis; Laplace transform; mathematical method; methodology; stochastic process",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldridge, D.F., Dosso, S.E., Endres, A.L., Oldenburg, D.W., New methods for constructing flattest and smoothest models (1991) Inverse Prob., 7, pp. 499-513; Constable, S.C., Parker, R.L., Constable, C.G., Occam's inversion: A practical algorithm for generating smooth models from electromagnetic sounding data (1987) Geophysics, 52, pp. 289-300; Fitzpatrick, B.G., Bayesian analysis in inverse problems (1991) Inverse Prob., 7, pp. 675-702; Hardy, R.L., Multiquadric equations of topography and other irregular surfaces (1971) J.

They have since developed a facility for obtaining subjective data and interpreting the processes underlying spatial activities. Recent migration and mobility research has focused upon environmental cognition, place preference, mental maps of movement behavior, the role of search, and the motives of stayers as well as movers. The main stress has been upon concept development and model formulation. Future research is likely to be increasingly concerned with space-time paths, asymmetric flows, and non-normal populations. Although the behavioral approach has helped expand the set of relevant variables, there is a continuing need for accumulating meaningful data sets and for more replication of experiments. © 1980 by the Association of American Geographers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boyle, M.J., Robinson, M.E., Cognitive Mapping and Understanding (1979) Ceography and the Urban Environment: Progress in Research and Applications, pp. 59-82. , Edited by D.

The geostatistical framework proposed in this paper deals with the spatial interpolation problem of downscaling areal data under such constraints, while: (1) explicitly accounting for support differences between sample data and unknown values, (2) guaranteeing coherent (mass-preserving) predictions, and (3) providing a measure of reliability (uncertainty) for the resulting predictions. The formal equivalence between Kriging and spline interpolation allows solving constrained area-to-point interpolation problems via quadratic programming (QP) algorithms, after accounting for the support differences between various constraints involved in the problem formulation. In addition, if inequality constraints are enforced on the entire set of points discretizing the study domain, the numerical algorithms for QP problems are applied only to selected locations where the corresponding predictions violate such constraints. The application of the proposed method of area-to-point spatial interpolation with inequality constraints in one and two dimension is demonstrated using realistically simulated data. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Coherence; Downscaling; Quadraticprogramming; Spline interpolation","algorithm; geostatistics; interpolation; kriging; numerical model; spatial analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arbia, G., (1989) Spatial Data Configuration in Statistical Analysis of Regional Economic and Related Problems, , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Barnes, R.J., Johnson, T.B., Positive Kriging (1984) Geostatistics for Natural Resources Characterization, 2, pp. 231-244. , In: Verly G et al (eds) D.

In many instances Tobler himself has led the way to these new insights and developments. Fundamental concepts begin with Tobler's cartographic transformations; Nyerges' deep and surface structure and data levels; and Moellering's real and virtual maps; the sampling theorem; and concepts of spatial primitives and objects. This list can be expanded to include additional analytical concepts such as spatial frequencies, spatial surface neighborhood operators, information theory, fractals, Fourier theory, topological network theory, and analytical visualization, to name a few. This base of analytical theory can be employed to analyze and/or develop such things as spatial surfaces, terrain analysis, spatial data schemas, spatial data structures, spatial query languages, spatial overlay and partitioning, shape analysis, surface generalization, cartographic generalization, and analytical visualization. More analytical uses of theory, strategies of analysis, and implementations are being developed and continue to multiply as the field continues to grow and mature. A primary goal is to expand the mathematical/analytical theory of spatial data analysis, and theory building and analytical visualization as analytical cartography takes its place in the geographic information sciences. The research future for this area appears very bright indeed.","Analytical cartography; Analytical operators; Deep and surface structure; Fourier theory; Fractals; Information theory; Map transformations; Real and virtual maps; Sampling theorem; Spatial frequencies; Spatial overlay; Spatial theory; Warntz network theory","Engineering research; Fractals; Geographic information systems; Information science; Information theory; Surveys; Virtual reality; Analytical cartography; Fourier theory; Geographic information science; Map transformations; Sampling theorem; Spatial frequencies; Spatial theory; Warntz network theory; Mapping; analytical method; cartography; conceptual framework; spatial data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdelguerfi, Madhri, Representation of 3-D elevation in terrain databases using hierarchical triangulated irregular networks: A comparative analysis (1998) International Journal of Geographic Information Science, 12 (8), pp. 853-873; Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Interactive maps for visual data exploration?

Numerical calculations were made on the basis of a geometrical model of the visual field. The projection results in a larger scale representation of isopter parts lying far from the pole (the point of fixation) as compared to more central parts. If the isopters on the perimetric hemisphere could be described by regular outlines symmetrical to a point, they would be represented as egg-shaped curves with the greater bulge farthest from the pole. The projected curves would lack a symmetry centre. Certain conditions of geometrical uniformity possibly pertaining to several isopters within one and the same visual field would also be concealed. The equidistant chart is not suitable for measuring angles outside the pole or non-meridional distances within isopters. The area enclosed by an isopter in this projection is not simply related to its solid angle. The polar azimuthal equidistant projection cannot always be considered the projection of choice for quantitative studies of the visual field. Some alternative projections are discussed. © 1970 S.

Contour lines produced by this method have correct relations to given discrete data points regardless of the spatial distribution of these points. The computer-generated maps are comparable to those drawn manually. The region to be contoured is divided into quadrilaterals whose vertices include the data points. After supplying values at each of the remaining vertices by using a surface-fitting technique, bicubic functions are constructed on each quadrilateral to form a smooth surface through the data points. Points on a contour line are obtained from these surfaces by solving the resulting cubic equations. The bicubic functions may be used for other calculations consistent with the contour maps, such as interpolation of equally spaced values, calculation of cross-sections, and volume calculations. © 1972 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Contour measurement; Digital computers; Computer generated; Contour line; Cubic equations; Data points; Discrete data points; Smooth surface; Surface fitting technique; Volume calculation; Surface fitting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Society of Exploration Geophysicists",,,,,00168033,,GPYSA,,"English","Geophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005222075

A test program measured the performance of relatively inexperienced map users in identifying locations on a topological cartogram and on the geographic map from which it was derived. The spatial pattern of errors and the variation in task difficulty showed the dominant influence of two map transformation characteristics: Change in angular location with respect to other units and change in unit shape. Also, it took significantly longer to perform the task on the map than on the cartogram. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cartogram; Place recognition; Shape","TOPOLOGICAL CARTOGRAMS; MAPS AND MAPPING; cartogram; place recognition.; shape",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blair, D.J., Biss, T.H., The measurement of shape in geography (1967) Bulletin of Quantitative Data for Geographers 11, , Department of Geography, University of Nottingham; Cole, J.P., King, C.A.M., (1968) Quantitative Geography, , London: Wiley; Dent, B.D., A note on the importance of shape in cartogram communication (1972) The Journal of Geography, 71, pp. 393-401; Dent, B.D., Communicative aspects of value-byarea cartograms (1975) The American Cartographer, 2, pp. 154-168; Dobson, M.W., Visual information processing during cartographic communication (1979) The Cartographic Journal, 16, pp. 14-20; Downs, R.M., Stea, D., (1973) Image and Environment, , Chicago: Aldine; Gibbs, J.P., A method for comparing the spatial shapes of urban units (1961) Urban Research Methods, pp. 99-106. , J.

He achieves this by estimating the population of cell i as a weighted average of the recorded populations at points j, where the weights are determined by the strength of the connection between cell i and point j.

The adequacy of such a transformation is first examined theoretically by considering systematic imaging errors along scan lines, as well as earth rotation and map projection effects, the latter in the form of an approximation. A more rigorous test is carried out by transforming points on hypothetical ideal LANDSAT images forwards to the map base by means of the projection equations and backwards again to the images by affine transformation. An experiment is then conducted in which digitized map data are matched to two selected actual LANDSAT images (Lake Erie region and Manitoba). In this context, the authors discuss problems of selecting and measuring control points and an iterative affine transformation procedure based on the gradual rejection of outliers. Finally, overlays of map grids and other linear features are produced. The residual standard errors range from 83 to 185 m at ground scale. © 1977.",,"MAPS AND MAPPING",,,,,"National Research Council Canada, NRC: A 7501","* Part of this paper is based on the second author's M.A. thesis at the Department of Geography, University of Waterloo (Kirby, 1975).

The strong components - sets of mutually reachable vertices - of each digraph are determined by an efficient algorithm. The results indicate that the broadest migration bases are possessed by a pair of Southeastern Florida counties (Dade and Broward); a pair of Chicago area counties (Cook and Du Page); the District of Columbia; and Pierce County, WA, which has a strong concentration of military installations. Though no contiguity constraints are imposed, the clusters - especially relatively small ones - are, as a strong rule, connected. A null hypothesis that these clusters are random can, using asymptotic approximations in this 3140-unit analysis, be rejected. Under an assumption of symmetric linkages, a systematic tendency for counties to have broad migration bases is exhibited.-from Author",,"Area Analysis; article; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; Geographic Factors; geography; migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; United States; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Area Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Geographic Factors; Migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; United States; Americas; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; North America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Statistics; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12265981","English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021645103

Of these, about 40 are equal area (a few of which are not significantly different from others), and about 20 have equidistant parallels. Many are mentioned only qualitatively if at all in references other than the original sources. Some 40 inventors are involved. Seven significantly different projections using sinusoids offer alternatives, such as flat or pointed poles, equal area, or equidistant parallels. A dozen elliptical pseudocylindricals offer these variations, perhaps more attractively, with added possibilities from full versus partial ellipses. Five parabolics are rounder and probably preferable aesthetically to their sinusoidal counterparts. Nine projections with hyperbolas or converging straight lines for meridians are almost useless. Over two dozen projections use less well-known curves in attempts to give maps less real or apparent distortion. They include seven pseudocylindricals that are at least as prevalent in published atlases as the utilized handful of classically-curved projections. The projections are described here with definitive formulas and comparisons of appearance, theory, and standard parallels to facilitate choices and calculations. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behrmann, W., Die beste bekannte flächentreue Projektion der ganzen Erde (1910) Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 56 (2), pp. 141-144; Edwards, T., (1953) A New Map of the World, the Trystan Edwards Homolographic Projection, , B.

The area is divided into triangles, of which the data points form the vertices. The interpolating function consists of a polynomial within each triangle. Across the boundary of each adjacent pair of triangles the values of the polynomials and their derivatives are matched to a prescribed degree. Third-degree polynomials permit matching of second derivatives, and fifth-degree polynomials are required for matching second derivatives. Boundary conditions may be imposed on the derivatives, and equations may be introduced to improve the smoothness of the interpolating function. The analytical nature of the function permits certain manipulations, for example calculation of directions of rays and intersection points in refraction seismology. The function could also be used for automatic contouring. © 1976.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahlberg, Nilson, Walsh, (1967) The Theory of Splines and their Applications, p. 284. , Academic Press, New York, N.Y; Bhattacharya, Bicubic spline interpolation as a method for treatment of potential field data (1969) GEOPHYSICS, 34, pp. 402-423; Birkhoff, Piecewise bicubic interpolation and approximation in polygons (1969) Approximations with Special Emphasis on Spline Functions, pp. 185-221. , I.J.

For example, geologists are interested in the production of trend surfaces and the associated contour maps from data consisting of the x,y map coordinates of bore locations and the corresponding depths below sea level at which a certain type of rock was found. Although the points at which data are available are not random, in general they are not at points of a rectangular grid. Similarly, for meteorological purposes, although the sites for weather stations can be chosen more rationally they are neither sufficiently dense nor precisely sited to form a complete grid. Many techniques have been used to produce grid values from the given data, most of which use either some triangulation method or else a local or global fit of polynomial or Fourier surfaces. James1 indicates some of the disadvantages of these methods, in particular the fact that in regression of either polynomial or two-dimensional Fourier series both represent finite expansions of infinite series with an increasing number of extrema and inflexions on further expansion. Both are linear with respect to their coefficients so they are both specific cases of the general linear model and thus are subject to the mathematical restrictions inherent in such models. James and Krumbein2 list those restrictions of importance geologically. James describes a method whereby a non-linear model in general mathematical terms is assigned as an educated guess based on the user's geological intuition. The method is iterative in the sense that the original model can be revised after further analysis of the residuals. © 1968 Nature Publishing Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cole, A.J.; Computing Laboratory, ",,,,,,,,00280836,,,,"English",,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949056392

This paper argues that the needs of such users are poorly met by the ‘mainstream’ model for GIS that is often presented in the literature. A PC-based system, equivalent in GIS terms to the spreadsheet, is described. It integrates simple data structures, limited map creation and editing, a powerful range of standard and spatially orientated statistical functions, and the ability to interactively present results through chloropleth, contour, proportionate symbol, or proximally shaded maps. It is par-ticularly designed to be easily accessible and to encourage visual interactive analysis. For some users such a system has acted as an adequate solution in its own right and for others it has provided a useful educational transition to more extensive and powerful systems. © 1990 Maney Publishing.",,"data structure; spatial analysis; visual analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abler, R.F., The National Science Foundation National Centre for Geographic Information and Analysis (1987) International Journal of Geographic Information Systems, 1 (4), pp. 303-326; Burrough, P.A., (1986) Principles of Geographic Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment.

Existing comparative static models are seriously limited in their ability to discuss growth and change, but existing dynamic simulation models are based largely on untested hypotheses. This paper emphasises the importance of integrating dynamic simulation modelling with a serious programme of experimental research devoted to the formal understanding of urban growth processes. It aims to explore which theoretical frameworks provide a useful orientation for this experimental research and concludes that the Markov property and kinetic theory allow a structuring of research by providing initially an accounting framework for the description of change through time, but the paper then emphasises that the experimentally observed transition parameters used in these approaches must be related to the causal variables that influence this change. Kinetic theory is then developed to illustrate this approach of hypotheses making within a time-oriented accounting framework and it is shown how the approach gives useful insights on the introduction of behavioral inputs into aggregate models. Migration analysis is taken as a focus because in simulation models this process is used to link the demographic and employment sectors, but also because it is the most volatile and currently least predictable component of population change. Ginsberg [1] has presented recently a strategy for integrating probabilistic migration models with causal theory which is based on Luce's [2] theory of choice behavior. The present paper differs in several ways, partly because the interest here primarily is in the provision of dynamic frameworks for spatial allocation models, but also because this paper focuses on kinetic theory as a source of insight on how this integration may be achieved. © 1972.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ginsbergeb, (1971) Critique of Probabilistic Models and Introducing Causal Structure and Exogeneous Information with Probabilistic Models, , Centre for Environmental Studies, London, Working Paper 73; Luce, (1959) Individual Choice Behavior, , J.

The corresponding spherical finite difference equations are derived.

Such effects are often poorly considered in downscaling, even though they often have significant impact on the results. The geostatistical approach proposed in this article considers two types of boundary conditions (BC), that is, a Dirichlet-type condition and a Neumann-type condition, while satisfying several critical issues in downscaling: the coherence of predictions, the explicit consideration of support differences, and the assessment of uncertainty regarding the point predictions. An updating algorithm is used to reduce the computational cost of area-to-point prediction under a given BC. In a case study, area-to-point prediction under a Dirichlet-type BC and a Neumann-type BC is illustrated using simulated data, and the resulting predictions and error variances are compared with those obtained without considering such conditions.

However, this model, due to its unrealistic homogeneity assumptions, generates an extremely rigid response by the endogenous variables to tariff reductions. Two approaches are discussed for introducing heterogenity: a deterministic utility-maximization and a probabilistic choice approach. Both lead to a substitution of the transportation model, which is embedded in the homogeneous model, by a trade-distibution model of the gravity type. In this framework regional shadow prices are derived which play the same role as those of the transportation model and can be used for measuring the impact of economic intergration on regional access to input and output markets. Finally a family of elastically constrained gravity models is considered, which are derived by price-elastic supply and demand with the trade-distribution model. These can be empirically applied for calculating simultaneously the effects of tariff reductions on regional supply and demand as well as on interregional trade. - Author",,"gravity type; interregional trade; model; regional shadow prices; supply and demand; tariff reductions; trade distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0308518X,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018921905

Computer-drawn graphics offer a new and relatively inexpensive way to assist the communication of complex technical information to both planners and non-technical people whose full potential is now beginning to be realized. This paper discusses the utility of graphics and introduces three computer-drawn graphic techniques which may be useful, both for analysis and presentation of results, in the transportation planning process. CENVUE(S) produces a three-dimensional, perspective-view map, on which virtually any type of transportation data or performance indicator can be displayed. VAP is designed to display origin-destination travel patterns in any region. TDN transforms a physical-distance network into a time-distance network so that effects of different speeds in the transportation network can be readily seen. The cost-effectiveness of each technique is briefly discussed and some recommendations for evaluating computer graphics techniques are provided to aid the user in further assessing their utility in the transportation planning process. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Each transformation then serves to segment the corresponding image into regions such that, for the implementation of the correction, all pixels within a region can be shifted by the same number of rows and columns. In other words, the actual correction is achieved by a series of local translations (zero-order transformations). Remaining problems are then the filling of holes in the output pictures and the finding of a common submatrix. The image registration which results, provides a preprocessing operation needed to combine data from multitemporal and multispectral photography. © 1974.",,"DATA PROCESSING; PHOTOGRAMMETRY; IMAGE PROCESSING; REMOTE SENSING; MAPS AND MAPPING",,,,,"National Research Council Canada, NRC","*Part of a research study supported by the National Research Council of Canada.",,,,,,,,,,"Ambrose, Shone, New Cartographic Techniques with the Zoom Transfer Scope (1971) Papers from the ASP-ACSM Fall Convention, pp. 110-124; Anuta, Spatial Registration of Multispectral and Multitemporal Digital Imagery Using Fast Fourier Transform Techniques (1970) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics, pp. 353-368. , Oct; Anuta, Geometric Correction of ERTS-1 Digital Multispectral Scanner Data (1973) LARS Info.

For the particular interpolation requirements of the cable net generation problem, a method of polar-coordinate smoothing spline functions is developed. Next a Newton-iterative method of automatic equal mesh generation is developed which uses the polar spline representation of the cable net surface. This method produces complete specification of the cable grid node locations and cable segments, including the irregular-length grid elements intersecting the net edge cables. Examples are presented to illustrate how the interpolation procedure functions and how the mesh generation procedure couples with the surface interpolation procedure to produce a satisfactory complete initial geometry specification. © 1974.",,"STRUCTURAL DESIGN - Computer Applications; CABLE NETS; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Argyris, Scharpf, Large deflection analysis of prestressed networks (1972) Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, 98 (No. ST3), pp. 633-654; Argyris, Scharpf, Berechnung vorgespannter Netzwerke, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Math.

Principal contributors to this subject were Craig and Hammer, both writing in 1910. A property of retro-azimuthal projections is that the parallels are bent downwards towards the equator. The resulting maps, when extended to the entire world, thus must overlap themselves. An unusual recent discovery from Iran suggests that Muslims might have been prior inventors of a similar projection, by at least several centuries. A later corollary by Schoy leads to a new ""cylindrical"" azimuthal map projection with parallels bending away from the equator, here illustrated for the first time.","Azimuthal directions; Map projections; Mecca; Qibla; Retro-azimuthals","Projection systems; Azimuthal map projections; Maps; azimuth; mapping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ali, J., Qibla determination (1967) The Determination of the Coordinates of Positions for the Correction of Distances Between Cities, 1025, pp. 241-263. , Translation of al Biruni's Kitab Tahdid al Amakin... .

Traditionally , these measures were related to the paramaters of Tissot's ellipse of distortion; therefore, they were infinitesimal measures. Only recently were the measures of errors in finite distances introduced in cartography in order to produce equidistant-like images. The mixed error measure (which combines the Airy's measure of deviations of Tissot's indicatrixes with the mean square measure of errors in finite distances) is proposed to derive the minimum distortion polyconic projection. Expressed as a 5th degree polynomial, this projection minimizes the deviations of Tissot's error ellipses from a unit circle, while preserving the geodesic distances between distinct points on the globe as much as possible. The resultant world map represents the best compromise between equal-area, conformal, and equidistant representations. The parameters of the optimal projection are given, and the operational procedure used to derive them is stated.",,"Mathematical Techniques--Polynomials; Combination Distortion Measure; Map Error Measures; Minimum Distortion Projection; Tissots Error Ellipses; Maps and Mapping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Laskowski, Piotr",,,"Publ by ACSM, Bethesda, MD, United States","Technical Papers - 1991 ACSM-ASPRS Annual Convention",,"Baltimore, MD, USA",15064,,,TPACE,,"English","Tech Pap ACSM ASPRS Annu Conv",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025842336

It appears that these grids can be well explained in terms of the Mecca-centred retro-azimuthal orthographic projection described in 1968 by J.E. Jackson. In this projection the lines of constant latitude reduce to a set of ellipses with their major axes parallel to the equator and the lines of constant longitude reduce to a set of non-equidistant straight lines parallel to the north-south direction. It is shown that the curves actually engraved on the instrument conform to this projection and can be fairly easily constructed. This interpretation of the grids on the Iranian instruments stands in contrast with another explanation, recently proposed by King (1999), which is based on medieval Arabic concepts such as the so-called 'method of the zijes'. Insufficiently accurate workmanship makes it impossible to distinguish between the two explanations through the study of the instruments themselves. The newly gained insight into the projection itself, however, shows that a direct relation between the Iranian maps and Islamic mappings known from the ninth century, as suggested by King, does not exist. Thus, it is concluded that it is as yet completely unknown when and where the very idea behind the Iranian cartographic grid was first conceived, and that the quest for their historical background is still open.",,"cartography; historical cartography; instrumentation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cantor, M., (1913) Vorlesungen über Geschichte Der Mathematik, , Zweiter Band, Teubner, Leipzig; (1993) Sales Catalogue of 8 November 1993, , Christie's; Comes, M., Review of King, D.

K1P 6B9, Canada; Snyder, J.P.","For Muslims, the question of how to determine the azimuth or Qibla (Sacred Direction) to Makkah during the five obligatory daily prayer sessions is of great importance. Differences of opinion exist among Muslims as to how to calculate the azimuth from parts of the world not previously inhabited by Muslims, such as the continents of the Americas and Australia. Presently, there are two major and distinct points of view on this issue (Almakky 1994), each with a significant group of advocates basing its views on the Holy Qur'an (Koran) and the Hadith (prophet saying). One group believes in the validity of the rhumb line angle used in the world map designed by Mercator (so that the azimuth from the United States, for example, is towards the SE). The other group believes in using the great circle to determine the azimuth (in which case, the direction from the United States is towards the NE). In either case, the exact angle of the Qibla depends on the location of the person in prayer. This study describes a method that takes into consideration the actual shape of the Earth as well as the various approaches taken by Muslim scholars to provide an equation with which a person, regardless of location, can determine the accurate azimuth. This method uses a universal reference ellipsoid centred at the Earth's centre of mass to precisely determine latitude and longitude and uses trigonometric functions to compute the great-circle path.",,"azimuth; cartography; ellipsoid; Makkah; Qibla",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Hajj, R.N., Kadi, A.-S.S., (1994) The Substance of the People of Truth That the Direction of Al-Qibla in the United States and Canada Is to the Southeast, pp. 2-74. , 1414 A.H.

The activities took two principal directions. The first involved a major review of progress made by recent migration research and an identification of the main challenges and opportunities which should be addressed over the next few years. The second utilised evidence from a variety of different information sources to provide an account of the dynamics of migration during the 1980s and, where more recent data was unavailable, of changes in migration occurring during the previous decade. This paper contains a selection of the findings of research conducted primarily by those members of the Working Party who contributed to the second initiative. The paper illustrates how the level of internal migration in Britain has fluctuated over time, identifies how migration propensities vary by population sub-group, demonstrates the changing geographical patterns of sub-national movement and presents a synopsis of regional perspectives. -from Author",,"information source; internal migration; migration trend; population distribution; regional perspective; UK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026302531

The new approach is based on the algebraic eigenvalue problem and makes use of the Singular Value Decomposition of the column-scaled Jacobian matrix of the mapping equations. The semiaxes of Tissot's Indicatrix are evaluated directly, and the usage of quadratic forms, which may cause unnecessary loss of numerical precision, is avoided. Several advantages of the new approach, versus the original Tissot's approach, are detailed.

These data bases were designed for use in a variety of climate-related studies (eg, surface albedo, surface roughness, biomass inventory and biomass change, net primary productivity, global modeling of trace gases) at global and continental scales. The 1o resolution of these data bases provides flexibility in aggregation to coarser spatial resolutions. In addition, the major benefit of the hierarchical classification schemes used in the compilations, ie, flexibility in both compilation and retrieval of data at various levels of detail, has allowed the derivation of a series of data bases tailored to individual applications. The data have been used independently, as inputs to both a 3-D general circulation model (GCM) and 3-D tracer-transport model, and as adjuncts to large-scale remote-sensing studies. -from Author",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022243248

Recent patterns of change for a 20 zone system covering the UK are described, and metropolitan non-metropolitan shifts are revealed to be much more important than N-S shifts. Levels of national and local mobility, age-group migration propensities and distribution patterns are described for the study set of zones. As a tool for consistent description and population projection, a system of populations accounts, accounts based models and data estimation tasks is outlined. Linked to this accounting framework are a set of alternative migration models.-Authors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020402726
