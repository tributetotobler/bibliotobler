From its incipient roots in landscape representation in geology and the mapping of socio-economic data in geography, it grew into its own sub-discipline with graduate programs, research paradigms, and a scientific literature of its own. It came close to establishing a national center for cartography In the late 1960s. After rather sporadic activity before World War II, the period from 1946 to 1986 saw the building of major graduate programs at the universities of Wisconsin, Kansas, and Washington. Other programs were created, often with the doctoral students from those three. At the end of the twentieth century, cartography underwent significant changes in relation to the emerging discipline of geographic information science. The future for academic cartography is less certain, as graduate programs adjust the balances among the many components of mapping science, including cartography, geovisualization, GI science, GIS systems, spatial analysis/statistics, and remote sensing.","2002","2020-06-03 13:03:51","2021-02-12 20:50:08","","305-321","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4W2KV24X","presentation","2007","Grasland, Claude","Global City revisited by Tobler's first law of géography","","","","","","This paper propose to examine if Waldo Tobler’s first law of geography “ everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” (Tobler, 1970) is still valid in a global world where many authors consider that distance in general and physical distance in particular are less and less important for the understanding of economic, political and social dynamics. Focusing on a “space of flows” rather than a “space of places” as it is proposed by many authors in their research on Global City does not mean that physical distance has to be  excluded from spatial interaction models, on the contrary.  We propose to explore a variant  of Tobler’s classical model of spatial interaction  - .(Fij.Dij) = Ai + Bj -  in order to demonstrate that the “movement” (product of flows by physical distance) is a much more interesting factor for the description of interaction between cities than the classical amount of flows. The advantage of this new formulation are both conceptual, methodological and empirical as it is demonstrated by an application to the air flows between world cities in 2000.  A new organization of the network of world cities according to air flows is elaborated which is more complex and less hierarchical than the one proposed in previous works. The paradox of the demonstration is that the introduction of distance support much more the assumption of a multipolarised and interlinked world than  usual works based on the location of global firms or the analysis of flows  non weighted by distance.","2007","2020-06-05 12:01:27","2020-06-05 12:04:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Montreux 'Suisse)","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15TH European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At individual level four basic times of position and interaction are defined (geographical/sociological and discrete/continuous). It is then necessary to discuss the effects of scale aggregation and time dynamics on the elementary levels of position and interaction. This part is illustrated by examples about airflows between world cities in 2000 and euro coins diffusion across borders between 2002 and 2007.","2009","2020-06-05 11:53:21","2020-06-05 11:59:55","","46 p.","","","","","","","","","","","University of Lausanne","Lausanne","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bavaud, F.; Mager, C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Waldo Tobler originated (in the 1960s) and nurtured (in the 1970s and 1980s) the idea of mathematical, transformational, or analytical approach to the subject. Tobler laid out the agenda for an analytical cartography in his seminal 1976 paper, “Analytical Cartography,” published in the American Cartographer. This paper, and Tobler’s ideas, had a profound effect on American academic cartography” (A History of Twentieth Century American Academic Cartography: McMaster, Robert B, Susanna McMaster, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 29 305-320, 2002).</p> <p>Each year, the AAG Geographic Information Science and Systems Specialty Group and the GIScience Journal Transactions in GIS collaborate to honor the legacy of Waldo Tobler by hosting a sponsored session, “The Waldo Tobler Distinguished Lecture in GIScience”, featuring a leading light in the field of GIScience. Please join AAG-GISS this year for an exciting and informative talk by a driving force in the field of GIScience.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","organisée par An Association of American Geographers Specialty Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
